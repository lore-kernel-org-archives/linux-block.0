Hi Eric,

By comments from Christoph, I think the original version is correct
enough. gfs2 is the only file system uses REQ_READAHEAD for metadata
readahead, if gfs2 developers agree to add REQ_PRIO when issue metadata
bio, we can use another patch to cache its metadata in bcache. Currently
we can just let this patch go ahead.

Thanks for your patient explaining to my question, and thanks to
Christoph to correct the concept of REQ_META and REQ_PRIO.

Please add Reviewed-by: Coly Li <colyli@suse.de> to your original
version patch.
