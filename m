That is bullshit.  I try to help block core where/when I can (did so
with discards and limits stacking, other fixes here and there).

Your take on what DM code is and how it evolved is way off base.  But
that is to be expected from you.  Not going to waste time laboring over
correcting you.

I do appreciate the immutable biovec work you did.  Helped speed up bio
cloning quite nicely.

But you've always been hostile to DM.  You'll fabricate any excuse to
never touch or care about it.  Repeatedly noted.  But this is a block
core bug/regression.  Not DM.

If you think I'm going to thank you for blindly breaking shit, and
refusing to care when you're made aware of it, then you're out of your
mind.

Save your predictably hostile response.  It'll get marked as spam
anyway.
