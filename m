The thing is, the 2 scenarios you are most concerned about have
_nothing_ to do with dm_mq_queue_rq() at all.  They occur as an error in
the IO path _after_ the request is successfully retrieved with
blk_get_request() and then submitted.

So it really makes me question why you think commit 6077c2d706097c0
addresses the issue you think it does.  And gives me more conviction to
remove 6077c2d706097c0.

It may help just by virtue of blindly kicking the queue if
blk_get_request() fails (regardless of the target is responding with
BUSY or not).  Very unsatisfying to say the least.

I think it'd be much more beneficial for dm-mpath.c:multipath_end_io()
to be trained to be respond more intelligently to BLK_STS_RESOURCE.

E.g. set BLK_MQ_S_SCHED_RESTART if requests are known to be outstanding
on the path.  This is one case where Ming said the queue would be
re-run, as detailed in this header:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/commit/?h=dm-4.16&id=5b18cff4baedde77e0d69bd62a13ae78f9488d89

And Jens has reinforced to me that BLK_MQ_S_SCHED_RESTART is a means to
kicking the queue more efficiently.  _BUT_ I'm not seeing any external
blk-mq interface that exposes this capability to a blk-mq driver.  As is
BLK_MQ_S_SCHED_RESTART gets set very much in the bowels of blk-mq
(blk_mq_sched_mark_restart_hctx).

SO I have to do more homework here...

Ming or Jens: might you be able to shed some light on how dm-mpath
would/could set BLK_MQ_S_SCHED_RESTART?  A new function added that can
be called from q->softirq_done_fn in response to BLK_STS_RESOURCE?  Or
is this level of control (and blk-mq detail) something that a blk-mq
driver should need to care about?

Anyway, we may need to get to that level of blk-mq driver controlled
retry optimization.

But Bart: again this is a vastly different feedback loop than the
stabbing in the dark your commit 6077c2d706097c0 is doing.
