Subject: [PATCH v3 05/13] bcache: quit dc->writeback_thread when BCACHE_DEV_DETACHING is set

In patch "bcache: fix cached_dev->count usage for bch_cache_set_error()",
cached_dev_get() is called when creating dc->writeback_thread, and
cached_dev_put() is called when exiting dc->writeback_thread. This
modification works well unless people detach the bcache device manually by
    'echo 1 > /sys/block/bcache<N>/bcache/detach'
Because this sysfs interface only calls bch_cached_dev_detach() which wakes
up dc->writeback_thread but does not stop it. The reason is, before patch
"bcache: fix cached_dev->count usage for bch_cache_set_error()", inside
bch_writeback_thread(), if cache is not dirty after writeback,
cached_dev_put() will be called here. And in cached_dev_make_request() when
a new write request makes cache from clean to dirty, cached_dev_get() will
be called there. Since we don't operate dc->count in these locations,
refcount d->count cannot be dropped after cache becomes clean, and
cached_dev_detach_finish() won't be called to detach bcache device.

This patch fixes the issue by checking whether BCACHE_DEV_DETACHING is
set inside bch_writeback_thread(). If this bit is set and cache is clean
(no existing writeback_keys), break the while-loop, call cached_dev_put()
and quit the writeback thread.

Please note if cache is still dirty, even BCACHE_DEV_DETACHING is set the
writeback thread should continue to perform writeback, this is the original
design of manually detach.

I compose a separte patch because that patch "bcache: fix cached_dev->count
usage for bch_cache_set_error()" already gets a "Reviewed-by:" from Hannes
Reinecke. Also this fix is not trivial and good for a separate patch.
