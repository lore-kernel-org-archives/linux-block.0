Subject: Re: [for-416 PATCH] bcache: fix writeback target calc on large devices

This patch is useful for preventing the overflow of the expression
(cache_dirty_target * bdev_sectors(dc->bdev)), but it also
lead into a calc error, for example, when there is a 1G and
100*164G cached device, it would cause the "target" value to
be aways zero of the 1G device, which would cause write-back 
threshold losing efficacy.

Maybe at first we can judge if it overflows or not of the expression 
(cache_dirty_target * bdev_sectors(dc->bdev)), if it overflows,
We can calc the value of target as the patch, otherwise, 
we calc it as old way.
