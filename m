Feedback on this patch below, but first:

There are deeper issues with the current->bio_list and rescue workqueues
than thread counts.

I cannot help but feel like you (and Jens) are repeatedly ignoring the
issue that has been raised numerous times, most recently:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2017-February/msg00059.html

FYI, this test (albeit ugly) can be used to check if the dm-snapshot
deadlock is fixed:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2017-January/msg00064.html

This situation is the unfortunate pathological worst case for what
happens when changes are merged and nobody wants to own fixing the
unforseen implications/regressions.   Like everyone else in a position
of Linux maintenance I've tried to stay away from owning the
responsibility of a fix -- it isn't working.  Ok, I'll stop bitching
now.. I do bear responsibility for not digging in myself.  We're all
busy and this issue is "hard".

This should be BLK_QUEUE_NO_RESCUER as DM isn't making direct use of
bio_queue_split() for its own internal spliting (maybe it should and
that'd start to fix the issue I've been harping about?) but as is DM
destroys the rescuer workqueue (since commit dbba42d8a9eb "dm: eliminate
unused "bioset" process for each bio-based DM device").
