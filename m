Hi Eric,

Michael is working on writeback improvement currently. He proposes some
patches to improve writeback efficiency from a little bit different
view, and after some quite deep discussion I feel some of his ideas are
promising. e.g. writeback more keys if backing device is idle.

Currently it seems a better writeback performance results more lock
contention in between with front end I/O. This is why Junhui posts a
realy time buckets in use counting patch. This is a start to reduce lock
contention in bcache tree writebac/gc/key insert.

I just feel this is a serieal continuous effort to improve writeback
efficiency. the 1-key/sec fix might be one of them, let's
improve-and-test :-)

Thanks.

Coly Li
