Hi Martin,

thanks!

I think it is actually pretty straightforward (if it can be said
about anything in the device-mapper little walled garden :-)

For the authenticated encryption (on the sector level) we cannot use
a length-preserving encryption (as it is dm-crypt in normal mode) but we need
some per-sector metadata to store additional authentication tag.

This is exactly what DIF/T10-PI already does, just we need more flexibility
(and larger metadata to use cryptographically sound modes).

So we developed dm-integrity target that takes a normal block device,
stores per-sector metadata on-disk in special sectors (interleaved with normal
data sectors).
(There is a journalling to provide atomicity of data + metadata writes.)

The dm-integrity can calculate some non-cryptographic integrity data itself,
but this mode does not use block integrity extension at all so it is not important here.

The second use case (that is currently broken by the block layer 4.13 changes)
is that dm-integrity can register a new integrity profile for the virtual device
(on top of normal block device) and present data sectors as normal bio layer and
metadata as the bio-integrity layer (dm-crypt will receive bio with the metadata
in integrity fields).

IOW dm-integrity is just "emulator" for the integrity-enabled block device,
just with configurable per-sector metadata size.

Then we can place dm-crypt above this device and process the bio the same way
as dm-crypt does, just it will add authentication tag mapped to the metadata
for that special integrity profile.

The dm-crypt already creates bio clones (and already owns the bio clone memory)
so we do exactly the same for integrity part of bio (clearing the BIP_BLOCK_INTEGRITY
flag to indicate that block layer should not free this memory).

Otherwise I think we use bio the exact way how the driver should register
and alloc memory for own integrity profile (see dm_crypt_integrity_io_alloc function).
