As a person who has written a fair amount of dm-snapshot code I'm free
to have my opinion.  It is slow.  Period.

If it works for you, great.  But it isn't adequate for most modern
usecases I'm aware of.

dm-snapshot is slow, as such I will badmouth it because dm-thinp is a
much more capable replacement.  I have to maintain both, so I'm free to
steer people according to my experience.

Even new XFS features will have bugs.  Just because XFS's fsck is
historically robust, oversights and bugs happen when new features are
added.  And AFAIK future XFS would be looking to leverage DM thinp via
its producer/consumer model.  But this is going off on a tangent now.

The Documentation was stale.  I personally don't reference it so the
need to update it got overlooked.

We could certainly improve out documentation for the use of thin_check
and thin_repair.  I know lvm2 has seen improvements to allow the metdata
voulme to be activated in standalone mode (activate the metadata volume
without the thin-pool or thin devices ontop) so that the thin_check and
thin_repair tools can be used on it.  I'd imagine you aren't aware of
the lvm2 package's lvmthin manpage?  See: man lvmthin
It'd likely be one of the documentation locations to see improvements.
I'll talk with others about where we can improve docs, the manpages for
thin_check and thin_repair are _very_ sparse.  Anyway, room for
improvement for sure.

But demonizing "enterprise support" like you don't provide that to your
stake holders is bizarre.  I again was candid and forthcoming about what
drives/catches the need for thin_check and thin_repair fixes and
improvements: it just so happens that "enterprise" deployments make use
of DM-thinp and have exposed the need for support more than community
users.  I'm not saying I, or other DM thinp oriented developers,
wouldn't provided the same type of support if a community user like
yourself hit a problem.  It is just that enterprise users are the
prontlines of advanced usage and scale.  Deploying hundreds of Gluster
servers with every brick layered ontop of DM thinp historically exposed
issues.  Those issues get fixed and benefit everyone.

This discussion, and my need to explain how "enterprise support" drives
innovation, is so.. weird.

Best wishes.  I've been dealing with stresses in my personal life
myself.  Might explain why we've had the awkwardness in this thread.
