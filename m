Subject: [for-416 PATCH] bcache: fix writeback target calc on large devices
Date: Wed, 27 Dec 2017 16:42:30 -0800
Message-Id: <20171228004230.3295-1-mlyle@lyle.org>
Sender: linux-block-owner@vger.kernel.org

Bcache needs to scale the dirty data in the cache over the multiple
backing disks in order to calculate writeback rates for each.
The previous code did this by multiplying the target number of dirty
sectors by the backing device size, and expected it to fit into a
uint64_t; this blows up on relatively small backing devices.

The new approach figures out the bdev's share in 16384ths of the overall
cached data.  This is chosen to cope well when bdevs drastically vary in
size and to ensure that bcache can cross the petabyte boundary for each
backing device.
