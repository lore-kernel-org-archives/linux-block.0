The sector number in the integrity tag must match the physical sector 
number. So, it must be verified at the bottom.

If the sector number in the integrity tag matched the logical sector 
number in the logical volume, it would create a lot of problems - for 
example, it would be impossible to move the logical volume and it would be 
impossible to copy the full physical volume.

It would be usefull if dm-crypt can put the autenticated tag directly into 
the integrity data. But for that usage, the lowest level physical driver 
must not generate or verify the integrity data - it must just read them 
and write them.
