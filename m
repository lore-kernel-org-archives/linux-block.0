It sounds interesting, hahahaha~~

you'd better to known how the data organized in disk,
and what is bkey, bset, btree node, and what erver else,
and think about deeply: If I am the author, how would I write
the code, and read the currently code, to find wether it written
as your thought, judge about is it your wrong or the author, Then 
you understood bcache, and bcache also understood you.

you also can ask our dear maintainer Mike, who knows all about bcache,
but sometiomes he is very busy, It is normally you would hear nothing 
from him for one weeks or two, sometimes maybe three, but never five, 
since the merge window comes.

Thanks,
