Subject: [for-4.16 PATCH 0/2] block: cope with gendisk's 'queue' being added later

Hi Jens,

Please consider PATCH 1/2 for 4.16 inclusion.  I've included PATCH 2/2
to show the DM changes needed in order to make use of the block
changes.

I think, all things considered, this moves DM's interface with block
core in a better direction for the long-term but I obviously welcome
any critical feedback.

Thanks!
Mike
