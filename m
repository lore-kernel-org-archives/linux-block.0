[I debated just ignoring this portion of your reply but it needs to be
dealt with directly]

I prefer how Linus handled it (at least he was timely with his
follow-ups).  Your initial reply where you joined a fragment of my
initial reply with Zdenek's (we sent simultaneously, each half way
around the world) served to merge Zdenek and myself into one fictional
straw-man you both could attack.  If you have something to say to _me_
address me directly; don't put words in my mouth because you thought I
had a complete mind-meld with someone else.

And please don't act like this wasn't already beaten to death yesterday;
which left me (as DM maintainer) initially _unwarrantedly_ compromised.
There was a block regression that I wasn't aware of but someone on my
broader team (Zdenek) papered over it in userspace rather than report it
as a regression.

I did brush off the seriousness of side-effects on readonly dm-snapshot
("Because dm-snapshot").  But that doesn't speak to some systemic
"problem" you seem to be concerned about.

You don't follow DM much, that's fine.  But thinp is considerably more
powerful for modern use-cases.

dm-snapshot's scaling is _awful_.  This is due to the N-way copy-out
penalty associated with N snapshots.  So lots of snapshots perform very
very slowly.  Even one snapshot is slow compared to dm-thinp.

dm-thin (2011) certainly is newer than dm-snapshot (well before 2005),
and yes dm-thin is complex, but dm-snapshot's code isn't exactly
"simple".  The on-disk layout is but that simplicity contributes to why
it doesn't scale at all.

DM thin is a modern approach to snapshots grounded in the same
btree-based concepts and design used by btrfs.  Given dm-thinp's
requirements and how it has been deployed and pushed _hard_ it really is
holding up amazingly well.

That's one definition for "exciting" on your Friday night ... ;)

The documentation was outdated, see this thread:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2018-July/msg00200.html

Where I shared that this Documentation update was staged for 4.19:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/commit/?h=dm-4.19&id=6c7413c0f5ab61d2339cf516d25bb44d71f4bad4

That said, thin_repair has shown itself to be hit-or-miss.  There are
certain corruptions that it doesn't cope with well (leaving the metadata
"repaired" but the result is an empty thin-pool).  Those cases are more
rare but still occur.

So repairing thinp corruption can require escalations through
"enterprise support" (which results in fixes to thin_repair, etc).

Apples and oranges.  DM thinp is complex but necessarily so.
dm-snapshot is still complex yet only covers legacy and narrow (read:
now useless) use-cases.

In the same thread I referenced above, see how Drew Hastings is looking
to use DM thinp to host VM guest storage, which implies a scaling
dm-snapshot has _zero_ hope of providing:

Already addressed this.
