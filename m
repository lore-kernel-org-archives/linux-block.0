Hello Coly,

Thanks for this serials.

As I known that, after calling cancel_delayed_work_sync(), if the work queue
is running, cancel_delayed_work_sync() would return only AFTER the work queue
runs over, else if the work queue does not run yet, cancel_delayed_work_sync()
will cancel the work queue imediately, so I think it is safe in 
update_writeback_rate() to access the cache set resource. Point me out if I
am wrong.
