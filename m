How did you find this?  Did the race trigger at detach or was it through 
code inspection?

I need to analyze this more.  It looks correct on its own, but there are 
a lot of atomic variables and the way they are used is complicated.

I'm inclined to think that detach should traverse the writeback lock for 
safety.  It would be a lot less complicated to analyze what would 
happen.  What do you think?

Thanks,

Mike
