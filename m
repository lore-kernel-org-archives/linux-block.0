Hello Ming,

My comments about the above are as follows:
- It can take up to q->rq_timeout jiffies after a .queue_rq()
   implementation returned BLK_STS_RESOURCE before blk_mq_timeout_work()
   gets called. However, it can happen that only a few milliseconds after
   .queue_rq() returned BLK_STS_RESOURCE that the condition that caused
   it to return BLK_STS_RESOURCE gets cleared. So the above approach can
   result in long delays during which it will seem like the queue got
   stuck. Additionally, I think that the block driver should decide how
   long it takes before a queue is rerun and not the block layer core.
- The lockup that I reported only occurs with the dm driver but not any
   other block driver. So why to modify the block layer core since this
   can be fixed by modifying the dm driver?
- A much simpler fix and a fix that is known to work exists, namely
   inserting a blk_mq_delay_run_hw_queue() call in the dm driver.

Bart.
