DM multipath just uses blk_stack_limits() to stack limits, which has:

        t->max_sectors = min_not_zero(t->max_sectors, b->max_sectors);
        t->max_hw_sectors = min_not_zero(t->max_hw_sectors, b->max_hw_sectors);
        t->max_dev_sectors = min_not_zero(t->max_dev_sectors, b->max_dev_sectors);

But I assume you realize that.. I'm just missing the relation you're
saying exists, or should exist, between max_hw_sectors and max_sectors
(other than the obvious: max_sectors cannot be greater than
max_hw_sectors) as they relate to stacking.

You're suggesting that when the DM multipath device's limits are stacked
up from the underlying devices: cap the mpath's max_hw_sectors to the
underlying devices' max_sectors?
