One year ago, I saw null_blk's IOPS can be decreased to 10%
of non-RQF_IO_STAT on a dual socket ARM64(each CPU has
96 cores, and dual numa nodes) too, the performance can be
recovered basically if per numa-node counter is introduced and
used in this case, but the patch was never posted out.
If anyone is interested in that, I can rebase the patch on current
block tree and post out. I guess the performance issue might be
related with system cache coherency implementation more or less.
This issue on ARM64 can be observed with the following userspace
atomic counting test too:

Yeah, it won't be a issue for non-mq path, and for blk-mq path,
maybe we can use some blk-mq knowledge(tagset?) to figure out
the 'in_flight' counter. I thought about it before, but never got a perfect
solution, and looks it is a bit hard, :-)
