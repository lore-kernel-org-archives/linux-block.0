It isn't a hard requirement.  But relative to a newer kernel, you simply
cannot deny that a newer lvm2 will work better than on older lvm2.  Not
even speaking about this block regression.  Lessons are learned, fixes
are made, support for the newer kernel's targets are available, etc etc.

That is where the suggestion to keep lvm2 updated along with the kernel
comes from.

It isn't about "oh we regress _all_ the time.. screw users!".

Please stop with the overreaction and making this something it isn't.
