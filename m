Fair enough, so just a side-effect of your all or nothing completion handling.

Which is exactly what we do _not_ want because it removed partial
completion.  Which is an important feature of DM multipath.  Christoph
echoed its importance some time ago:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2015-May/msg00228.html

Not seeing how.  Yes, the current implementation will not account for a
part of the request that failed.  That is fine.. the bio failed, so
nothing to update!

So no, I don't understand why you've added the 'exit' goto to update the
request on error.  If the request is to be failed upgrades it'll get
updated as a side-effect of that completion due to error (if multipath
is configured to fail_if_no_path or whatever).
