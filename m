No actually it was (not that there's anything wrong with that):

    dm mpath: requeue after a small delay if blk_get_request() fails

    If blk_get_request() returns ENODEV then multipath_clone_and_map()
    causes a request to be requeued immediately. This can cause a kworker
    thread to spend 100% of the CPU time of a single core in
    __blk_mq_run_hw_queue() and also can cause device removal to never
    finish.

    Avoid this by only requeuing after a delay if blk_get_request() fails.
    Additionally, reduce the requeue delay.

Note that this commit actually details a different case where a
blk_get_request() (in existing code) return of -ENODEV is a very
compelling case to use DM_MAPIO_DELAY_REQUEUE.

SO I'll revisit what is appropriate in multipath_clone_and_map() on
Monday.

I need a break... have a good weekend Bart.
