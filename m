I just fully explored the bdev lookup aspect of the DM code (thinking
somehow we were dropping the partno on the floor).

That aspect all looks fine, so I didn't send an email detailing my
findings.

I didn't think to look at block core's partition remapping having a
side-effect of losing the partition info.  Nasty.  But even if that is
the case, shouldn't the bio have been updated to reflect the proper
offset into the device?

I think: I hate block core's partition code! ;)

The 2nd option seems better, but I still need to get to the bottom of
_why_ the completing bio isn't properly describing the IO that was
issued.  It cannot have it both ways.  If it strips the partition info
(and just maps IO relative to front of entire disk) then the bio should
to be updated reflect this.

Too late here now, will look tomorrow.

OK.
