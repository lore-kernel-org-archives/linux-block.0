Yes, so you are right that there are still possibilities for blocking -
e.g. we could get blocked in reclaim when allocating memory somewhere. Now
we hope what Goldwyn did will be enough for practical purposes as in the
end this is an API to improve performance and so in the worst case app
won't get the performance it expects (this just has to be rare enough that
it all pays off in the end). Also if we spot some place that ends up to
cause blocking in practice, we'll work on improving that...

Probably we could add a note to the first paragraph of the changelog of
patch 4/10 like: Note that we can still block (put the process submitting
IO to sleep) in some rare cases like when there is not enough free memory
or when acquiring some fs-internal sleeping locks.

WRT test results, Goldwyn has some functional tests (for xfstests). We also
have a customer that is working on testing the series with their workload
however that will take some time given it requires updating their software
stack. If you are looking for some synthetic benchmark results, I suppose
we can put something together however it's going to be just a synthetic
benchmark and as such the relevance is limited.
