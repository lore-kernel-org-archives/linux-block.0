Hi, Michael--

Thanks for the quickly reply.

If the metadata on the cache device was NOT correctly read,
cached_dev_read_error() will not be called, so the recovery check will
not be executed. so this patch is safe.
s->iop.error was not set when faild to read metadata on the cache
device, so the  cached_dev_bio_complete() will be called instead of
cached_dev_read_error()
