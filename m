Right, I later realized this was the call chain you were referring to.
Not sure how I missed it the first time around.

SO you're saying the case that Neil doesn't think should happen:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2017/11/21/658
...can happen.

Makes sense.  But I need to think further about _why_ bios submitted to
the snapshot driver's underlying device would end up on md->rescued
(like you suggested above).  Again, Neil thinks it not possible.  Neil
said:
"they will not be recursive calls, so nothing will be added to
current->bio_list[0] and nothing will be moved to md->rescued.  Each
generic_make_request() will completely submit the request in the lower
level devel."
