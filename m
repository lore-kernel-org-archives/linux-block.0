Subject: [PATCH] block: early return from blk_queue_split() if q->bio_split
 is NULL

DM appears to be the only block driver that doesn't lean on the block
core's bio splitting.  My hope is to fix that but in the meantime it
doesn't make sense for a device that doesn't need blk_queue_split() to
go through the associated work.
