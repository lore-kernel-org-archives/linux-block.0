We are not reducing the chance of blocking, but detecting if the call
would block and return to userspace as soon as possible rather than
waiting for the blocking factor. One of the blocking factor is the mutex
inode->i_rwsem (formerly i_mutex). The performance gain should come from
the application depending on how they use it. Here is an example:

A database application has compute and I/O threads. This effort will
allow the compute threads to push writes without the need of context
switch to I/O thread, since it knows that it will end soon enough
without blocking. If a IOCB does block (and returns -EAGAIN), it would
be deferred to the I/O thread. Usually the compute thread should know
the offsets of writes, and be careful not to overwrite other writes.

I will be posting one test case to xfstests.

I agree to the quibbles you have on patch 02/10. Should I send the
entire fixed series, just the 02/10 patch, or would you prefer to fix it?
