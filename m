Please see queue_delayed_work_on(), hctx->run_work is shared by all
scheduling, once blk_mq_delay_run_hw_queue(100ms) returns, no new
scheduling can make progress during the 100ms.

I guess GFP_KERNEL may never fail, but GFP_ATOMIC failure might be
possible, and it is mentioned[1] there is such code in mm allocation
path, also OOM can happen too.

  if (some randomly generated condition) && (request is atomic)
      return NULL;

It is from blk_get_request(underlying queue), see multipath_clone_and_map().
