Maybe I'm missing something, but the code we have in place splits it
into max sectors for software and hardware. Shouldn't the stacked
devices have max_hw_sectors capped to what the lower levels support? If
that was done, we would not have to worry about a user fiddling with
max_sectors_kb, since it could only be smaller (or equal to) the max
size of the lower level.
