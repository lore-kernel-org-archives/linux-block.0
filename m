I found a problem with the patches when using loop device - we must not 
offload bios to the rescue thread if they are allocated from fs_bio_set. 
I'll send a second version of the patches with this change. You can 
incorporate that change to your git tree.

The behavior depends on the timer only in a situation when the deadlock 
actually happens - the timer doesn't hurt performance on normal use. So, 
it's better to have timed delay in bio processing than a deadlock :)

The timer part can be dropped entirely if someone shows that offloading 
bios on schedule doesn't hurt performance in any way. Does anyone have a 
large collection of block layer performance tests that could be tried to 
detect if the regression happens?
