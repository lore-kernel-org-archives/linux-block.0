Subject: [PATCH v4] dm: don't allow ioctls to targets that don't map to whole devices
Date: Sat,  4 Feb 2017 10:45:03 +0100
Message-Id: <20170204094503.19322-1-hch@lst.de>
List-ID: <linux-block@vger.kernel.org>

.. at least for unprivileged users.  Before we called into the SCSI
ioctl code to allow excemptions for a few SCSI passthrough ioctls,
but this is pretty unsafe and except for this call dm knows nothing
about SCSI ioctls.

As the SCSI ioctl code is now optional, we really don't want to
drag it in for DM, and the exception is not very useful anyway.
