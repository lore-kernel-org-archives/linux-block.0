You got what I meant. I just hope people can know how errors are handled
without extra document. In auto mode, print out kernel message to
indicate why bcache device is stopped or not might be useful to users to
understand what's going on.

OK, I get your point, it makes sense. This is just a rough thought from
me, the motivation was to avoid on-disk format change.

It is possible to add flag in bcache superblock, but it means on disk
format modification, this is something I try best to avoid. I need to
check the code before I have the answer of yes or no.

Sure I agree. Indeed the suggestion and feedback for you and Nix helps
me quite a lot :-) Firstly I try to avoid data corruption and provide
flexibility to enterprise and personal users, then we can improve it in
future if someone may provide better suggestion than yours :-)

Thanks.
