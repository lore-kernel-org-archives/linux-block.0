Hi Stefan,

Current I just organize patch files not a git tree branch. The reason
is, I send bcache patches by emails to Jens and Cc linux-bcache and
linux-block, in order to make more people notice the patches.

Currently the patches can be found here (today's change not pushed yet),
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/colyli/bcache-patches.git/tree/

for-next: this directory contains patches under serious testing and for
next merge window
for-test: this directory contains all meaningful patches, I verify them
when I have time, they are candidate of for-next.

Michael is preparing a git tree at mean time, maybe we will take care
patches in form of git tree soon.

Thanks.

Coly Li
