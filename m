Please stop, seriously.

You've not explained it many times.  We cannot get a straight answer
from you.  No analysis that establishes that if an underlying dm-mq
multipath path is out of tags (shared or otherwise) that dm-rq core
_must_ run the hw queue after a delay.  

Commit 6077c2d7060 just papers over a real blk-mq problem (that may now
be fixed).  Your assertions that blk-mq would need to otherwise poll
(and waste resources so it can immediately retry) ignores that blk-mq
_should_ make progress as requests complete or if/when a path is
recovered, etc.  So I'm not going to accept your dysfuctional reasoning
on this, sorry.  _THAT_ is my job as a maintainer.
