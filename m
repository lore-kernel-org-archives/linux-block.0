I have to treat your above comment as a noop since you never provide a explanation.

Also I don't think it is wrong to deal with MPATHF_QUEUE_IO/MPATHF_PG_INIT_REQUIRED
via DM_MAPIO_DELAY_REQUEUE, since both can seldom happen, and the delay
won't cause performance issue.

The idea behind this change is that this patchset switches to return BLK_STS_RESOURCE
to blk-mq only when we run out of resource, but the above two(MPATHF_QUEUE_IO and
MPATHF_PG_INIT_REQUIRED) don't belong to 'run out of resource'.

OK, that is a problem, will fix it in V2.
