I think it would be easier for everyone concerned if Coly could attach
the fio script / cmdline and the bcache setup here.
There still is a chance that both are correct, as different hardware
setups are being used.
We've seen this many times trying to establish workable performance
regression metrics for I/O; depending on the hardware one set of
optimisations fail to deliver the expected benefit on other platforms.
Just look at the discussion we're having currently with Ming Lei on the
SCSI mailing list trying to improve sequential I/O performance.

But please try to calm down everyone. It's not that Coly is deliberately
blocking your patches, it's just that he doesn't see the performance
benefit on his side.
Might be that he's using the wrong parameters, but than that should be
clarified once the fio script is posted.

At the same time I don't think that the size of the dataset is
immaterial. Larger datasets take up more space, and inevitably add more
overhead just for looking up the data in memory. Plus Coly has some
quite high-powered NVMe for the caching device, which will affect
writeback patterns, too.

Cheers,

Hannes
