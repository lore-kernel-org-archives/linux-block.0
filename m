I've reasoned through a few different ways to respond to this.  Fact is
you're not giving me much to work with.  AFAIK you _are_ charted with
supporting the types of storage configs that you've requested
performance results from.

Your dm-rq.c commit 6077c2d706097c0 ("dm rq: Avoid that request
processing stalls sporadically") silently went in through Jens:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2017-April/msg00157.html
Not sure why that happened to begin with honestly.

But at the end of that post I meant to say:
"If this dm-mq specific commit is justified the case certainly is
_not_ spelled out in the commit header."

Anyway, I've split this contentious removal of dm_mq_queue_rq's
blk_mq_delay_run_hw_queue(hctx, 100/*ms*/) into a separate patch; but
at this point I'm still inclined to accept it for 4.16.

I'll hopefully look closer at understanding the need for commit
6077c2d706097c0 tomorrow.

In the meantime, I'd _really_ appreciate it if you'd give the rest of
the changes Ming has proposed in this patchset a much more open mind!

Thanks,
Mike
