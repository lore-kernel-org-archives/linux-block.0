The patch below seems to work fine (given quick testing).. It also has a
side-effect of not breaking integrity support (which commit 18a25da8
appears to do because it isn't accounting for any of the integrity stuff
bio_split, or dm.c:clone_bio, does).

FYI, my other concerns in my my previous reply were unfounded and due to
misreading the existing code.

Neil, please still feel free to have a look at this to see if you can
recall why you used bio_clone_bioset().

If in the end you agree that the following patch is fine please let me
know and I'll get a proper fix staged.

Thanks,
Mike
