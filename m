Yes indeed, forgot that. Needed after the quiesce.

dying is still used on blk-mq, but yes, the bypass check should now be
frozen for blk-mq. Not really directly related to the above change,
but it should be fixed up.

What is the test case? Full details please, from hardware to what you
are running. As I've mentioned before, I don't necessarily think your
performance issues are related to scheduling. Would be nice to get
to the bottom of it, though. And for that, I need more details.
