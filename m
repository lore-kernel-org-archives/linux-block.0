I would like to chime in agree fervently with Mark.  

We have a pair of very busy hypervisors with a complicated block stack 
integrating bcache, drbd, LVM, dm-thin, kvm, ggaoed (AoE target), zram 
swap, continuous block-layer backups and snapshot verifies to tertiary 
storage, cgroup block IO throttled limits, and lots of hourly dm-thin 
snapshots replicated to tertiary storage.  All of this is performed under 
heavy memory pressure (35-40% swapped out to zram).

The systems work moderately well under cfq, but *amazingly well* using 
BFQ.  I like BFQ so much that I've backported v8r2 to Linux v4.1 [1].

+1 to upstream this as a new scheduler without replacing CFQ.

Including BFQ would be a boon for Linux and the community at large.
