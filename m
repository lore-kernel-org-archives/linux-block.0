OK, I got your mean. It is safe run work update_writeback_rate when 
cancel_delayed_work_sync() is called, but it is not safe to re-arm itself
to workqueue again.

So, the first judgement  "if (test_bit(CACHE_SET_STOPPING, &c->flags))"
is not very nessary, we only need the second one to prevent the work 
from re-arming itself to workqueue.


Thanks,
