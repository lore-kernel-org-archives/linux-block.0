... and dirty data can be beyond dirty percent without front-end write
requests happening, right?  dirty data being significantly beyond
dirty percent means that we fell far behind at some point in the past,
because the spinning disk couldn't keep up with the writeback rate...

I really don't even understand what you're saying.  Front-end write
exists existing that will make their way to the backing disk will only
happen if writeback is bypassed or if they're judged to be sequential.
The point of writeback is to eat these front-end write requests.

Sure, but it doesn't lay the ground work for plugging..

I mean this:  imagine the writeback rate is high with the current
code, and the writeback code issues read requests for backing
locations 1,2,3,4,5,6, which are noncontiguous on the SSD.

1, 3, 4, 5 are read quickly and the underlying elevator merges 3, 4, and 5.

2 & 6 arrive 2ms later.

What happens?

Keeping the set of dirty_io objects that are being issued in a list so
that it's easy to iterate contiguous ones doesn't change the
commitment behavior.

The idea is this: the group of up-to-5 IOs that the current patch
gathers, are put in a list.  When all 5 have been read, then the
device is plugged, and the writes are issued together, and then the
device is unplugged.  Kent suggested this to me on IRC.

What this code says is, you're willing to get up to 50ms "ahead" on
the writeback for contiguous I/O.

This is bad, because: A) there is no bounds on how much you are
willing to aggregate.  If the writeback rate is high, 50ms could be a
lot of data, and a lot of IOPs to the cache device.  The new code
bounds this.  B) Even if a single I/O could put you 50ms ahead, it
still could be advantageous to do multiple writes.

See the above example with the lack of write-ordering-enforcement.
