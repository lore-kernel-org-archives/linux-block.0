This feels wrong to me. If a cache device is writethrough, the cache is
a pure optimization: having such a device fail should not lead to I/O
failures of any sort, but should only flip the cache device to 'none' so
that writes to the backing store simply don't get cached any more.

Anything else leads to a reliability reduction, since in the end cache
devices *will* fail.
