Sorry Bart but even in my test (using null_blk with queue depth of 8, 12
hw queues on 12 cpu system, with 12 fio jobs) it is yielding performance
improvement.  Going from 1350K iops to 1420K iops.  And 5275MB/s to
5532MB/s.  For sequential fio workload.

This test has been a staple of mine for a very long time.  The
improvement is very real (and hard to come by).  The iops improvement is
a bellweather for improved efficiency in the fast path.

So all your concern about Ming's testing is fine.  But you'd really help
me out a lot if you could give these changes a test.

You may think you explained it.. but IIRC it was very hand-wavvy.  If
you can provide a pointer to what you think was a compelling argument
then please do.

But I'm left very much unconvinced with your argument given what I see
in patch 2.  If blk_get_request() fails it follows that BLK_STS_RESOURCE
should be returned.  Why is the 100ms delay meaningful in that case for
SCSI?

OK, so please test it.

The changes are pretty easy to review.  This notion that these changes
are problematic rings very hollow given your lack of actual numbers (or
some other concerning observation rooted in testing fact) to back up
your position.
