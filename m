Well, it seemed to indicate a certain attitude that both Linus and I
are concerned about.  I tried to use more of a "pursuading" style to
impress why that attitude was not ideal/correct.  Linus used a much
more assertive style (e.g., "Hell, no!").

On a side note, this is the first that I've heard the assertion that
dm-thin was better than dm-snapshot.  My impression was that
dm-snapshot was a proven code base, that only did one thing and (as
far as I could tell) did it well.  In contrast, dm-thin is much newer
code, **far** more complex, with functionality and corner cases
approaching that of a file system --- and just to be even more
exciting, it doesn't have an fsck/repair tool to deal with corrupted
metadata.

In your opinion, is it because you disagree with the assumption that
dm-thin is scary?  Or is the argument that dm-snapshot is even
scarier?

P.S.  It could be that my impression is wrong/out-dated, but the
kernel documentation still says that userspace tools for checking and
repairing the metadata are "under development".  As a file system
developer, the reaction this inspires is best summed up as:
