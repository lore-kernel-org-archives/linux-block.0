Hello Coly,
Thanks for your works!

Acctually stopping write-back thread and writeback_rate_update work in 
bcache_device_detach() has already done in:
https://github.com/mlyle/linux/commit/397d02e162b8ee11940a4e9f45e16fee0650d64e

Is it nessary to add "rate_update_canceled" to identify that
whether writeback_rate_update work are already stoped or not? 
I think it is ok to call cancel_delayed_work_sync(&dc->writeback_rate_update)
twice before the memory of writeback_rate_update being released (It will return
-ENOENT).

>Delayed worker dc->writeback_rate_update and kernel thread
>dc->writeback_thread reference cache set data structure in their routine,
>Therefor, before they are stopped, cache set should not be release. Other-
>wise, NULL pointer deference will be triggered.
>
>Currenly delayed worker dc->writeback_rate_update and kernel thread
>dc->writeback_thread are stopped in cached_dev_free(). When cache set is
>retiring by too many I/O errors, cached_dev_free() is called when refcount
>of bcache device's closure (disk.cl) reaches 0. In most of cases, last
