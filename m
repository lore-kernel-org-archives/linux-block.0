Thanks for that link.  I'll try to make time to experiment with the test
code and confirm my proposed approach doesn't break it.

In that email Kent mentions "punt off to a per request_queue workqueue".

That "per request_queue workqueue" is what I'm trying to get rid of.  I
don't think this is a good direction.

I'd like to confirm that my approach
1/ doesn't re-introduce a deadlock
2/ doesn't hurt performance
and then merge it.

Though to be honest, I don't recall exactly what "my approach" is.
Your next email picks out two important patches which probably cover
it.  If/when I get to do the testing I'll let you know how it goes.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
