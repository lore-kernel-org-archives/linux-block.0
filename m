Hi,

blk_mq_debugfs_register() is called in blk_register_queue() from add_disk(),
and blk_mq_debugfs_register() need queue's information to setup mq debugfs
stuff.

But your patch does fix this issue, cool!

OK, thanks for your explanation.

After taking close look at your patches, I think this approach is clean.
But there are still corner cases which need to be addressed:

1) in the following disk attributes, queue is referenced, so we have
to add check in their show/store operations since the attributes
are shown up just after disk is added.

     disk_alignment_offset_show
     disk_discard_alignment_show
     part_timeout_show/part_timeout_store

2) same issue on /proc/diskstats: see diskstats_show()

3) in IO path, looks we already checked disk->queue in
generic_make_request_checks(), so it should be fine, and you set
disk->queue after the queue is fully initialized in the 3rd patch.

Thanks,
Ming Lei
