Yes, init read_dirty_data to true is an option, but I think it is not
so easy to judge whether it is all clean, because a read request may
cover several keys(just as Coly mentioned in previous reply), probably
some of them are dirty, others are clean, and cache_lookup_fn() was
called on each of these keys when read request search them on btree,
which means we should count and mark them in some place?

Maybe we can set s->iop.status when metadata I/O error, and clear
s->recoverable at the same time (add the code in cache_lookup(), after
bch_btree_map_keys() returns), then it can goto the read_error path,
and will not goto the recovery code.  This option is just a idea,
certainly, we should consider other exception cases.

Thanks,
