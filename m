Hi Junnhui,

Yes I agree with you, if cache mode is switched from writeback to
writethrough or writearound mode, and then the cache device is
disconnected, this patch does not help us.

When I replied question from Kai Krakow, I expressed similar opinion as
yours. This patch is a best-effort fix, it is very necessary for data
base applications which always use writeback mode and not switch to
other mode during all their online time.

Thanks.

Coly
