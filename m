But while reviewing this asymetry I found that the sysfs_create_link()
that I moved to blk_register_queue() needs to be guarded against
GENHD_FL_HIDDEN -- I didn't notice the GENHD_FL_HIDDEN early return in
register_disk().  I'll get that fixed up.

But unrelated to my patch: I think I found another curious imbalance, in
current upstream code, relative to GENHD_FL_HIDDEN.
bdi_register_owner() is only called if !GENHD_FL_HIDDEN but
bdi_unregister() is called unconditionally.  Not sure what is needed to
address that issue because I'd have thought that the bdi would be needed
regardless of GENHD_FL_HIDDEN.  Christoph?
