Hi Christoph,

Why revert? The data there are integrity protection data, just it must to be
processed together with encryption through crypto API call (it is just AEAD,
it must take data + auth tag together).

And the integrity profile is perfect interface for this, we register
own profile through the proper interface.
(Any other solution for per-sector metadata would be worse, I tried...)

And yes, I agree that there should have been review form Martin,
TBH it was not intention to squeeze it there, seems everyone forgot
about this (but the patch went through dm-devel for months).
(Initially it was part of my research work so I care about idea and not patches
just it becomes production code too fast :-)

Anyway, we have it in 4.12 and from my point of view (as cryptsetup
maintainer) this is very needed functionality.

So what do you suggest to do now? I do not think we break anything,
just we need to agree how to use that integrity extension for additional
profiles.

Milan
