Right. So the two modes I'm running in are:

1. 80 null_blk devices, each with one submit_queue, with one fio job per null_blk device,
   so 80 threads total. 80 logical CPUs
2. 1 null_blk device, with 80 submit_queues, 80 fio jobs, 80 logical CPUs.

In theory, the two should result in similar numbers. 

Here are the commands and fio configurations:

Scenario #1
modprobe null_blk submit_queues=80 nr_devices=1 irqmode=0

FIO config:
[global]
buffered=0
invalidate=1
bs=4k
iodepth=64
numjobs=80
group_reporting=1
rw=randrw
rwmixread=100
rwmixwrite=0
ioengine=libaio
runtime=60
time_based

[job1]
filename=/dev/nullb0


Scenario #2
modprobe null_blk submit_queues=1 nr_devices=80 irqmode=0

FIO config
[global]
buffered=0
invalidate=1
bs=4k
iodepth=64
numjobs=1
group_reporting=1
rw=randrw
rwmixread=100
rwmixwrite=0
ioengine=libaio
runtime=60
