Looks like this work has come a long way.  While I am _still_ not
hearing from any customers (or partners) that SMR is a priority I do
acknowledge that that obviously isn't the case for WDC and others.

So, I'll sign up for reviewing this DM target, with a focus on DM
interface and implementation details, _after_ I get some technical
review (e.g. Reviewed-by) from people like Hannes and others more
invested in the SMR technologies.  Basically I don't know enough about
the constraints of these devices to fully appreciate and catch some
issue in the particulars of the algorithms used to mitigate SMR's
quirks.

I'd also like to understand how invested WDC is in maintaining this DM
target for years and years if/when I were to merge this DM target into
mainline.

Thanks,
Mike
