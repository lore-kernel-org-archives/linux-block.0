Hello Mike,

I thought twice, and feel this patch is a little complex and still not very accurate for
small backend devices. I think we can resolve it like this:

     uint64_t cache_dirty_target =
         div_u64(cache_sectors * dc->writeback_percent, 100);

-    int64_t target = div64_u64(cache_dirty_target * bdev_sectors(dc->bdev),
-                   c->cached_dev_sectors);
+    int64_t target = div64_u64(cache_dirty_target,
+                    div64_u64(c->cached_dev_sectors, bdev_sectors(dc->bdev)));

c->cached_dev_sectors is always bigger than bdev_sectors(dc->bdev), so 
div64_u64(c->cached_dev_sectors, bdev_sectors(dc->bdev) would be never smaller than 1,
and this expression has no multiplication operation, so we do not need to worry
about overflows.

we also can multiply a value(2^10) to avoid loss of accuracy in division like bellow:
(it would support all device smaller than 2^54 BYTE).
+    int64_t target = div64_u64(cache_dirty_target<<10,                            
+                    div64_u64(c->cached_dev_sectors<<10, bdev_sectors(dc->bdev))); 

How do you think about?

> Bcache needs to scale the dirty data in the cache over the multiple
> backing disks in order to calculate writeback rates for each.
> The previous code did this by multiplying the target number of dirty
> sectors by the backing device size, and expected it to fit into a
> uint64_t; this blows up on relatively small backing devices.
> 
> The new approach figures out the bdev's share in 16384ths of the overall
> cached data.  This is chosen to cope well when bdevs drastically vary in
> size and to ensure that bcache can cross the petabyte boundary for each
> backing device.
> 
> This has been improved based on Tang Junhui's feedback to ensure that
> every device gets a share of dirty data, no matter how small it is
> compared to the total backing pool.
