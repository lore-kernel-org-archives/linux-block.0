If we just do separate opcodes for them, then there's 32 bits of flag
space for each one. That should be more than adequate.

There is already space for that. We have 3 x 64 bits at the end of the
sqe, 16 of those are used for the fixed buffers which networking
probably wants to support as well. But that still leaves 112 bits of
space for things opcode specific data.
