Fine.

That was how blk_insert_cloned_request() was before.  From the patch
header (you may have missed it):

"Commit bd166ef18 ("blk-mq-sched: add framework for MQ capable IO
schedulers") switched blk_insert_cloned_request() from using
blk_mq_insert_request() to blk_mq_sched_insert_request().  Which
incorrectly added elevator machinery into a call chain that isn't
supposed to have any."

So shouldn't blk_insert_cloned_request() be made to _not_ use
blk_mq_sched_insert_request()?  We'd need a new block interface
established, or equivalent open-coded in blk_insert_cloned_request(),
to handle direct dispatch to an mq request_queue's queue(s).
