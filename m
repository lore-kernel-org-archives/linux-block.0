It was 50 ms before it was 100 ms.  No real explaination for these
values other than they seem to make Bart's IB SRP testbed happy?

Sure, I'll add a #define.

As for the value of 100, we're dealing with path faults so retrying them
extremely fast could be wasted effort.  But there is obviously no once
size fits all.  As storage gets faster 100 ms could prove to be very
bad.

But without tests to verify a change, there won't be one.

Thanks,
Mike
