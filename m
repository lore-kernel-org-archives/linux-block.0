Of course PATCH 02/04 needed a v6.

I could make it even simpler by dropping 02/04 entirely.  But I do think
it worthwhile to try to get 02/04 in at this time too.

Anyway, I've genuinely tested with blk-mq now.  Sorry for all the

But I really would appreciate you giving this patchset serious

DM is long overdue for this fix.
