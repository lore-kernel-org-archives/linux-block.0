Hi, Coly--
Thanks for your detailed review notes.

Yes, your example about metadata of upper layer code provides a good reference ,
Indeed, I met the xfs metadata error a few days ago when I use xfs on bcache,
under heavy load, I got the following xfs error:
localhost kernel: XFS (bcache0): metadata I/O error: block 0x3e3e2af0
("xfs_trans_read_buf_map") error 4 numblks 16
And I can confirm it was caused by the read race.

The word "never" I used in above is not suitable:-/, thanks for your point,
 what I want to say is we will not recover clean data UNTIL the whole cache
device become clean, or in writethrough mode.

At least, for now, I find that when cache_lookup() traverse btree,
if bch_btree_node_get() return ERR_PTR(-EIO), it will not pass to upper layer,
cached_dev_bio_complete() will be called, just like there is no any IO error,
I think this is another bug. I'll deep into code and find more detail
when I have time.

Thanks,
