My whole point was - when someone has 'enough time' to compile fresh new 
kernel, spending couple seconds to build also recent lvm2 should have be no 
issue. Bugs are continually fixed, new feature from newer kernel are being
used, known problems are being addressed - that's  all what it means.
Bug are fixed not just in kernel, but also in user-space.

dm-snapshost has really outdated design - it's been useful in the old age 
where megabyte was hell lot of space.

Nowadays, when users do need to handle snapshots in multi gigabyte sizes and 
moreover have number of snapshots from the same volume taken over the time, 
want to take snapshot of snapshot of snapshot, the old snapshot simple kills 
all the performance, uses tons of resources and becomes serious bottleneck of 
your system and has lots of usability limitation.

That's where  thin provisioning will shine....

However if you still need to take short-living smallish snapshot and you want 
to use non-provisioned origin device, there the snapshot will still work as 
proven technology -  just no one can expect it will scale for the recent 
device size explosion...
