Are you saying the path would be reinstated via the 'reinstate_path'
message or by table reload?  Table reload will kick the requeue list.
'reinstate_path' doesn't (and there isn't an easy way to have dm-mpath
inform dm-rq core to do so -- could add a new function...)

If I can wire up requeue list kick on reinstate_path then the 5 secs is
perfectly fine and won't hurt how quickly IO is resumed once a path
comes back.
