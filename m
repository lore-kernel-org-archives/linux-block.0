Hi Joseph,
your description of the problem would be complete *if* sync write
requests were issued as expected.  But the problem I have seen, and
tried to solve with my patch, is that async requests easily eat all
request tags (I'm referring to blk-mq of course).  So sync I/O has a
hard time finding free tags for its requests, and is then throttled
upstream.  Differentiating throttling downstream may not solve this
problem, because async requests will accumulate upstream as before.
The problem may even get worse, because downstream throttling may
increase the duration of upstream congestion.

My patch tries to solve this upstream problem.  BFQ then does the
rest, downstream, for me.  Things may change in your scenario, though:
you may not have this upstream problem at all, or you may have both
the upstream and the downstream problems.

Thanks,
Paolo
