That race basically doesn't exist for a 10ms gap.

How so? It's _exactly_ the same as what you are proposing, except mine
will potentially run the queue when it need not do so. But given that
these are random 10ms queue kicks because we are screwed, it should not
matter. The key point is that it only should be if we have NO better
options. If it's a frequently occurring event that we have to return
BLK_STS_RESOURCE, then we need to get a way to register an event for
when that condition clears. That event will then kick the necessary
queue(s).

GFP_ATOMIC basically never fails, unless we are out of memory. The
exception is higher order allocations. If a driver has a higher order
atomic allocation in its IO path, the device driver writer needs to be
taken out behind the barn and shot. Simple as that. It will NEVER work
well in a production environment. Witness the disaster that so many NIC
driver writers have learned.

This is NOT the case we care about here. It's resources that are more
readily depleted because other devices are using them. If it's a high
frequency or generally occurring event, then we simply must have a
callback to restart the queue from that. The condition then becomes
identical to device private starvation, the only difference being from
where we restart the queue.

I would hope so, but the proposed solutions have not filled me with
a lot of confidence in the end result so far.

Where does the dm STS_RESOURCE error usually come from - what's exact
resource are we running out of?
