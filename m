Nak.

It still takes a bit time to add this request to hctx->dispatch_list
from here, so suppose the time is longer than 100ms because of interrupt
, preemption or whatever, this request can't be observed in the scheduled
run queue(__blk_mq_run_hw_queue).

Not mention it is just a ugly workaround, which degrades performance
a lot.
