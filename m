I thought about this, but as I think you've noticed below it's very
inaccurate for typical cases.  e.g. if you have 1TB and 750GB backing
volumes, you get (1750/1000) vs (1750/750) and the 750GB is allowed
half as much dirty space, and you end up storing 150% of the desired
info.  Other rounding approaches aren't good, either.

This is a bit better.  It trades a per-backing-volume limit of 1PB in
my code for a total of 9PB cached limit.

Really all of these approaches are "wrong" because they don't allow
the total amount of dirty to be used if you have quiet volumes and
should be replaced with something better.  I am just trying to get
something temporary in to 4.16 because this is a real bug that is
preventing real users from using bcache.  I'm pretty sure the new code
works in all the cases the old code failed.

Simultaneously having a 1GB and 16TB cached volume is a bit of a silly
case, and what the code does in this silly case isn't completely
stupid, so...

We're running out of time to get a fix into the package for 4.16, and
I've tested the current version a fair bit.
