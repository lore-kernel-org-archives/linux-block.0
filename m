I rebased your patchset ontop of Bart's patchset that I've already
staged in linux-dm.git's 'dm-4.12' branch.

When I try to apply this rebased patchset, it turns out 'dm-4.12' is
missing linux-block.git commit 8fc779805 ("dm mpath: don't check for
req->errors").  Because of this your first patch ("dm mpath: merge
do_end_io into multipath_end_io") won't apply due to conflict.

Not sure how we skin this cat.  Unfortunately Jens cannot easily pick
this rebased patchset up because he'll be missing all of Bart's changes
that I've staged in linux-dm.git's 'dm-4.12'.

In hindsight, linux-block.git commit 8fc779805 likely should've been
routed through linux-dm.git.  But not a big deal.

How should we skin this cat of getting your changes into 4.12?  I could
send a 2nd pull request to Linus after both linux-block.git and
linux-dm.git are merged... sound OK?

Until then, and/or for now, I've staged the fully merged result in
linux-next via linux-dm.git's 'for-next', see:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/log/?h=for-next
