Subject: [PATCH] [PATCH v2] bcache: segregate flash only volume write streams from cached devices
Date: Wed, 22 Nov 2017 11:25:29 +0800

From: Tang Junhui <tang.junhui@zte.com.cn>

In such scenario that there are some flash only volumes
, and some cached devices, when many tasks request these devices in
writeback mode, the write IOs may fall to the same bucket as bellow:
| cached data | flash data | cached data | cached data| flash data|
then after writeback of these cached devices, the bucket would
be like bellow bucket:
| free | flash data | free | free | flash data |

So, there are many free space in this bucket, but since data of flash
only volumes still exists, so this bucket cannot be reclaimable,
which would cause waste of bucket space.

In this patch, we segregate flash only volume write streams from
cached devices, so data from flash only volumes and cached devices
can store in different buckets.

Compare to v1 patch, this patch do not add a additionally open bucket
list, and it is try best to segregate flash only volume write streams
from cached devices, sectors of flash only volumes may still be mixed
with dirty sectors of cached device, but the number is very small.
