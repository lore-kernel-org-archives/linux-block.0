That's not what my patch series does. The only writes added by my patch 
series are those for the non-aligned head and tail of the range passed 
to blkdev_issue_zeroout().

Sorry but I don't like this proposal. I think that a much better 
solution would be to pause I/O before making any changes to the 
discard_zeroes_data flag.
