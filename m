Sure, I should have ACKed it a month ago already.  As I said, I believe
you the crypto. And you added the kmap_atomic as I pointed out.
All good.

You'd need "data-integrity-alg" set (or "verify-alg", and then have it
do an online-verify) to excercise the crypto stuff,
and you'd need a highmem system (are these still out there?)
to have the kmap not be a no-op.  But I don't see any potential problem.

Thanks!
