It's 240GB (half of a Samsung 850) in front of a 1TB 5400RPM disk.

The size isn't critical.  1/8 is chosen to exceed 10% (default
writeback dirty data thresh), it might need to be 1/6 on really big
environments.  It needs to be big enough that it takes more than 100
seconds to write back, but less than 40% of the cache[1].

I am also running this on "mountain", which is my virtualization
server.  It has 2x Samsung 950 PRO 512GB NVMe disks (MD raid1) in
front of 2x Seagate Ironwolf 6TB (MD raid1) drivers.  I can't run
benchmarks on it, but it runs nightly builds and is otherwise lightly
loaded in the middle of night.  It does writeback for about 75 minutes
on average after a set of nightly builds of my repositories (last 5
days 75, 79, 77, 72, 76); without this patch set it was more like 80
(77, 80, 74, 85, 84, 76, 82, 84).  It has 128GB of RAM and doesn't do
many reads-- most of its hottest working set hits the page cache--
bcache serves to accelerate the random writes its workloads generate.
This is the workload that I sought to improve with the writeback
changes.

When you ran the tests, did you compare 1-5 to 1-3?  Because
otherwise, another uncontrolled factor is the writeback tuning is
drastically different with patch 2.  (On most systems patch 2 makes
writeback less aggressive overall by default).

[1]: If you don't think this is fair--- this would match how I've been
suggesting enterprise users set up bcache for various workloads-- a
writeback cache isn't going to be very effective at lowering write
workload if the size of the most active write working set doesn't fit
nicely in the cache.  so e.g. if you deploy under a SQL database the
cache should be double the size of the indices to get a real write
aggregation benefit; if you deploy under an environment doing builds
the cache should be double the size of the amount written during
builds; if you deploy under an environment doing rapid VM provisioning
the cache should be double the size of the images blitted per
provisioning cycle, etc.

Basically if this criterion isn't met, the writeback cache doesn't do
very much to improve performance.  I think the test scenarios you ran
didn't satisfy this :/
