Hello Bart

Firstly let me start with : You have always been kind, patient and helpful
to me and myself the same to you so I am not keen to get in the middle of
this.

But its not true about Red Hat because I work very hard on this and I very
often find bugs you are not seeing so Red Hat is adding value here.
I emailed you a number of times asking if you can provide me the exact
steps, but not via your srp-test suite.

I have a setup that is not conducive to running your loop disconnects etc.
and if you are seeing a stall on multiple loops of 02-mq I should be able
to reproduce it with out having to run your test suite.

Please let me know how I can help

Laurence
