You're right.  In that case I think we should just skip this series
and I'll dust of the patch to just kill the non-mq support for 3.14
if the switch of scsi to default to mq works out for 3.13.

I think this mode makes sense in the long run - to get rid of the
legacy request code in dm.  But as long as we keep both modes arounds
the use for it seems a big questionable indeed.
