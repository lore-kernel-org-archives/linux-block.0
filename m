Subject: [PATCH v1 05/10] bcache: stop dc->writeback_rate_update if cache set is stopping

struct delayed_work writeback_rate_update in struct cache_dev is a delayed
worker to call function update_writeback_rate() in period (the interval is
defined by dc->writeback_rate_update_seconds).

When a metadate I/O error happens on cache device, bcache error handling
routine bch_cache_set_error() will call bch_cache_set_unregister() to
retire whole cache set. On the unregister code path, cached_dev_free()
calls cancel_delayed_work_sync(&dc->writeback_rate_update) to stop this
delayed work.

dc->writeback_rate_update is a special delayed work from others in bcache.
In its routine update_writeback_rate(), this delayed work is re-armed
after a piece of time. That means when cancel_delayed_work_sync() returns,
this delayed work can still be executed after several seconds defined by
dc->writeback_rate_update_seconds.

The problem is, after cancel_delayed_work_sync() returns, the cache set
unregister code path will eventually release memory of struct cache set.
Then the delayed work is scheduled to run, and inside its routine
update_writeback_rate() that already released cache set NULL pointer will
be accessed. Now a NULL pointer deference panic is triggered.

In order to avoid the above problem, this patch checks cache set flags in
delayed work routine update_writeback_rate(). If flag CACHE_SET_STOPPING
is set, this routine will quit without re-arm the delayed work. Then the
NULL pointer deference panic won't happen after cache set is released.
