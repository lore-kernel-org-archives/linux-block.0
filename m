Hi Nix,

Thanks for pointing out this. Sure, I will replace all typos with
'stale'. Good suggestion :-)

I didn't notice such a confusion without your suggestion, thank you!
allow_stale_data_on_failure is good for me.

I will send out another patch, fix 'stale' and rename sysfs entry to
allow_stale_data_on_failure.
