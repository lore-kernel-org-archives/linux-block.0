But they might not actually be done. AFAIU the CPU is allowed to do
the WRITE_ONCE of the head before doing any of the reads from the sqe
- loads and stores you do, as observed by a concurrently executing
thread, can happen in an order independent of the order in which you
write them in your code unless you use memory barriers. So the CPU
might decide to first write the new head, then do the read for
io_get_sqring(), and then do the __io_submit_sqe(), potentially
reading e.g. a IORING_OP_NOP opcode that has been written by
concurrently executing userspace after userspace has observed the
bumped head.
