I get your concern, and I'd like a second opinion on how much we should
care about this, but it doesn't look like there are many other callers
that would be effected here. The only existing caller of
__blk_crypto_submit_bio() is blk_crypto_submit_bio(), which would just
call it with "need_acct=true". Looking at the code path below
__blk_crypto_submit_bio() that would need to change for submitting the
bios:

__blk_crypto_submit_bio() is the only caller of
blk_crypto_fallback_bio_prep()

blk_crypto_fallback_bio_prep() is the only caller of
blk_crypto_fallback_encrypt_bio().

blk_crypto_fallback_encrypt_bio() is the only caller of
__blk_crypto_fallback_encrypt_bio(), which is the function that would
need to choose between submit_bio() and submit_bio_noacct().

Doing this would change the crypto API (by necessity, since we're adding
a new argument to __blk_crypto_submit_bio() for stacking devices to
use), and it is adds a extra argument to a number of functions, just to
handle this corner case. But it is still a relatively contained change.
