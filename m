Decided it a better use of my time to review and then hopefully use the
block-core's bio splitting infrastructure in DM.  Been meaning to do
that for quite a while anyway.  This mail from you just made it all the
more clear that needs doing:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2017-September/msg00098.html

So I will start here on this patch you proposed:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2017-September/msg00091.html
(of note, this patch slipped through the cracks because I was recovering
from injury when it originally came through).

Once DM is using q->bio_split I'll come back to this patch (aka
"[1]") as a starting point for the follow-on work to remove DM's use of
BIOSET_NEED_RESCUER:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2017-August/msg00315.html
