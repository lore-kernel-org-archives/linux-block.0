Hi again,

I think I have sort of identified the problem. It appears to me that
both the block layer and dm-crypt is defected on handling this.

First of all, check out the "fallback" zero out implementation, which
is used in this case, here:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/block/blk-lib.c?h=v4.12#n309

>From the outer loop, it seem to imply that this should be done in
multiple "bio"s, if the request (original "nr_sects") is larger than
BIO_MAX_PAGES:

...
while (nr_sects != 0) {
        bio = next_bio(bio, min(nr_sects, (sector_t)BIO_MAX_PAGES),
                        gfp_mask);
...
}
...

However, there is a inner loop:

...
        while (nr_sects != 0) {
                sz = min((sector_t) PAGE_SIZE >> 9 , nr_sects);
                bi_size = bio_add_page(bio, ZERO_PAGE(0), sz << 9, 0);
                nr_sects -= bi_size >> 9;
                sector += bi_size >> 9;
                if (bi_size < (sz << 9))
                        break;
        }
...

which apparently would loop over the whole request on its own, making
the outer loop a bogus one.

The request ends up being done in a single (huge) bio. When the bio is
passed on to dm-crypt, it appears that dm-crypt will not split the bio
either when it allocates buffer for conversion/encryption:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/md/dm-crypt.c?h=v4.12#n1694

which leads to possible enormous uptake of memory, causing OOM / kernel panic.

There seems to be some measure that is suppose to split large bio though:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/drivers/md/dm-crypt.c?h=v4.12#n2787

Apparently it is called before kcryptd_crypt_write_convert() /
crypt_alloc_buffer(). However, I don't really parse
dm_accept_partial_bio() (or the comment about it) so I don't really
know what it actually does or how it does it. Neither can I see it
helps in reality anyway.

Here is another test case that shows the problem:
