OK good, but is that too brittle to rely on? Something that might change
in the future?

I'm missing how these details relate to the goal of bypassing any
scheduler that might be attached.  Are you saying the attached elevator
would still get in the way?

Looking at blk_mq_sched_insert_request(), submission when an elevator
isn't attached is exactly what I made blk_mq_insert_request() do (which
is exactly what it did in the past).

In the case of DM multipath, nothing else should be submitting IO to the
device so elevator shouldn't be used -- only interface for submitting IO
would be blk_mq_insert_request().  So even if a scheduler is attached it
should be bypassed right?
