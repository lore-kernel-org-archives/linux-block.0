Hi Hannes,

The problem is not cached_dev, it is cache_set. In
__update_writeback_rate(), struct cache_set is referenced. The solutions
is similar as you suggested, call cancel_delayed_work_sync() before
deleting struct cache_set. Junhui posted another patch to fix duplicated
writeback threads issue, but also fixes this problem too. Therefore just
prevent this kworker from re-arm itself again should be enough, and my
next patche to stop dc->writeback_thread and dc->writeback_rate_update
can be ignored, Junhui's patch is in bcache-for-next already.

Thanks.

Coly Li
