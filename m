Jens & everyone-- thanks for the speedy review and handling.  I've
updated my test cases to ensure that volumes from old releases work,
even when I "don't think" there's been a disk format change.

One could... Right now almost all the uses of bio_copy_dev are in bcache
and they need to change for other reasons.  (e.g. macro uses parameter
more than once, function is passed in as parameter).  There's a whole
lot of places to change if it's desired to make bio_copy_dev universally
used to copy device information.

Yes, when I was grepping around there were other things that looked
possibly unsafe.  I don't have test environments for all of these other
subsystems.

I wanted to get the minimal fix for this in, though, because people are
actively losing data to the problem it triggers with bcache.
