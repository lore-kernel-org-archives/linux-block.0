Yes, as always, the caller will perform the immediate requeue -- this is
a requirement for blk-mq but I made .request_fn do the same just for
consistency in the request-based DM code.

In the case of blk-mq it is done in terms of a BLK_MQ_RQ_QUEUE_BUSY
return from .queue_rq (which is the most immediate requeue there is
since blk-mq just puts the request back on its dispatch list for the
very next queue run).

(it is so quick that it causes excessive load when all paths are down,
hence this patchset to only use immediate requeue when it makes sense)

Mike
