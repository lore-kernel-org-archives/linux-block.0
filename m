( Its not really relevant to this bugfix, but please see this thread since 
  you were curious about a wider audience discussion: 
  https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2016-July/msg00556.html )

The note above in the previous email was intended to explain how we 
discovered the dm-crypt problem, purely as an example use case.  The 
stable commit note discusses the real issue: lost elevator hints.

This commit fixes elevator ioprio hints passing through dm-crypt and is 
not intended to address dm-cache, nor enable a bcache feature.

All impementations using ioprio hints beneath dm-crypt would 
benefit---most importantly, _CFQ_ !
  
As it is, all ioprio hints passing through dm-crypt are lost to the 
elevator; the elevator looses those useful bits because of queuing to 
another thread for crypto operations.

The patch is trivial: +5 lines in dm-crypt.c (excluding `if` bracing), a 
helper function in bio.h, and a 1-line fixup in bio.c.  Thus, the stable@ 
inclusion since it would probably patch down to v3.x somewhere and help 
everyone who uses dm-crypt with ionice.

Its only 4.10-rc1, and as a bugfix it could be accepted as a stable commit 
for 4.10-rc2 or later if you are willing to help dm-crypt users who use 
ionice.  Indeed, if you so choose, you could both accept this commit and 
still re-work it in 4.11.

This is to benefit everyone, using kernels both old and new.

Cheers,

-Eric
