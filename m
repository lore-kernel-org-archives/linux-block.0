OK, how about the following document?

/*
 * BLK_STS_DEV_RESOURC: Block layer and block driver specific status,
 * which is usually returned from driver to block layer in IO path.
 *
 * BLK_STS_DEV_RESOURCE is returned from driver to block layer if device
 * related resource is run out of, but driver can guarantee that queue
 * will be rerun in future for dispatching the current request when this
 * resource is available.
 *
 * Difference with BLK_STS_RESOURCE:
 * If driver isn't sure if the queue can be run again for dealing with the
 * current request after this kind of resource is available, please return
 * BLK_STS_SOURCE, for example, when memory allocation, DMA Mapping or other
 * system resource allocation fails and IO can't be submitted to device,
 * BLK_STS_RESOURCE should be used for avoiding IO hang.

#define BLK_STS_DEV_RESOURCE	((__force blk_status_t)13)

Thanks,
Ming
