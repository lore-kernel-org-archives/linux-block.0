Streams is essentially the only thing ki_hint is currently used for,
with the write life time hints mapping to a stream. The idea for the
user side API was to have other things than just write life time hints.

Since Adam wants to do priorities, he'd either need to pack into the
existing ki_hint, or do this patch does, which is make it smaller and
add a new member. I think the latter is cleaner.
