In general the delayed requeue was meant to cope (slightly better) with
queue_if_no_path and no paths being available.  I think patch 1 respect
that intent.  And patch 2 looks right to me, BLK_STS_RESOURCE definitely
should be returned if blk_get_request() fails.

So I picked these up for dm-4.16 (and staged them in linux-next).  I
reworded both headers and the 2nd patch's block comment, see:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/commit/?h=dm-4.16&id=64e4e12bf474cf3aaaf59245bbeba3057d2fedf9

Bart, if for some reason we regress for some workload you're able to
more readily test we can deal with it.  But I'm too encouraged by Ming's
performance improvements to hold these changes back any further.

I've merged dm-4.16 and for-4.16/block and patched 3 - 5 apply cleanly
(so we won't have any merge conflicts during 4.16), resulting git branch
is here:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/snitzer/linux.git/log/?h=block-4.16_dm-4.16

I'll reply to patches 3 - 5 individually with my Reviewed-by.
Jens, please feel free to pick them up for 4.16.

Thanks,
Mike
