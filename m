Yes, this is a good and simple way.

Truely, this issue is rare. But as we known, cache set is a sharable pool,
we may attach various devices on it, such as petabyte big device or gigabyte
small device. We would better to make them all works well in the same 
cache set.

Ha, I don't think it is difficult to do, actually you have provided a 
simple and effective way above, and we can use a small partition device
and a big partition device to test (such as a 100M device and a 2T device). 
I believe you can do it better.
