Nice to see you've lowered your standards...

Maybe now we can revisit this line of work? ;)

I'm not seeing anything in elevator_switch() that would prevent an
elevator from attempting to be used on an mq device with > 1 hw queue.
But I could easily be missing it.

That aside, this patchset has all the makings of a _serious_ problem
for dm-mq multipath (e.g. if dm_mod.use_blk_mq=Y and
dm_mod.dm_mq_nr_hw_queues=1).  There is a bunch of code in
drivers/dm/dm-rq.c that looks at q->mq_ops vs not to determine if mq
is used vs old .request_fn.

I think we really need a way to force an allocated mq request_queue
(with a single hw_queue) to not support this technological terror
you've constructed. (*cough*
http://es.memegenerator.net/instance/58341711 )

In fact I'd prefer there be a mechanism to only allow this if some
opt-in interface is used... or the inverse: dm-mq can allocate a
blk-mq request_requeue that will _never_ support this.

I could be super dense on this line of work.  But what is the point of
all this?  Seems like a really unfortunate distraction that makes the
block code all the more encumbered with fiddley old vs new logic.  So
now we're opening old .request_fn users up to blk-mq-with-scheduler vs
non-blk-mq bugs.

Color me skeptical.  In time, maybe I'll warm to all this but for now
we need a big "OFF!" switch (aside from DEFAULT_MQ_SCHED_NONE, in
request_queue allocation interface).

FWIW, dm-multipath has supported a top-level .request_fn
requeue_queue, legacy elevator and all, stacked on blk-mq queue(s) for
quite a while.  If people _really_ want this you could easily give it
to them by forcing the use of the DM "multipath" target with
multipath's "queue_mode" feature set to "rq".
