OK, thank you very much for this.  Really helps.

For starters multipath_clone_and_map() could do a fair amount more with
the insight that a SCSI "BUSY" was transmitted back.  If both blk-mq
being out of tags and SCSI "BUSY" simply return BLK_STS_RESOURCE then
dm-mpath doesn't have the ability to behave more intelligently.

Anyway, armed with this info I'll have a think about what we might do to
tackle this problem head on.

Thanks,
Mike
