This is not correct:

   2206 static void dm_wq_work(struct work_struct *work)
   2207 {
   2208         struct mapped_device *md = container_of(work, struct mapped_device, work);
   2209         struct bio *bio;
   2210         int srcu_idx;
   2211         struct dm_table *map;
   2212
   2213         if (!bio_list_empty(&md->rescued)) {
   2214                 struct bio_list list;
   2215                 spin_lock_irq(&md->deferred_lock);
   2216                 list = md->rescued;
   2217                 bio_list_init(&md->rescued);
   2218                 spin_unlock_irq(&md->deferred_lock);
   2219                 while ((bio = bio_list_pop(&list)))
   2220                         generic_make_request(bio);
   2221         }
   2222
   2223         map = dm_get_live_table(md, &srcu_idx);
   2224
   2225         while (!test_bit(DMF_BLOCK_IO_FOR_SUSPEND, &md->flags)) {
   2226                 spin_lock_irq(&md->deferred_lock);
   2227                 bio = bio_list_pop(&md->deferred);
   2228                 spin_unlock_irq(&md->deferred_lock);
   2229
   2230                 if (!bio)
   2231                         break;
   2232
   2233                 if (dm_request_based(md))
   2234                         generic_make_request(bio);
   2235                 else
   2236                         __split_and_process_bio(md, map, bio);
   2237         }
   2238
   2239         dm_put_live_table(md, srcu_idx);
   2240 }

You can see that if we are in dm_wq_work in __split_and_process_bio, we 
will not process md->rescued list.

The processing of md->rescued is also wrong - bios for different devices 
must be offloaded to different helper threads, so that processing a bio 
for a lower device doesn't depend on processing a bio for a higher device. 
If you offload all the bios on current->bio_list to the same thread, the 
bios still depend on each other and the deadlock will still happen.
