Well I looked at this because Zdenek reported that with more recent
kernels he is seeing the "bioset" per DM device again (whereas it was
thought to be removed with mikulas' commit dbba42d8 -- but that commit
removed "bioset" only in terms of q->bio_split.

Looks like the q->bio_split bioset is created with BIOSET_NEED_RESCUER
but DM calls bioset_free() for q->bio_split.  Strikes me as odd that
"bioset" was removed DM devices until it recently reappeared.
Especially if what you say is accurate (that BIOSET_NEED_RESCUER was
implied with the old code.. I believe you!)

I tried to quickly answer how "bioset" is now re-appearing for DM
devices but I obviously need to put more time to it.

(And my goodness does this bioset rescue workqueue need a better name
than "bioset"! Should include the bdevname too)

No need to resend.  I'll work through the old threads.

I'm all for properly removing BIOSET_NEED_RESCUER from DM.

I'll look closer at all of this in the morning (for now I'm backing the
patch I referenced out from linux-next)
