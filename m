Hi Ming,

Please see https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2017-April/msg00190.html

Specifically:
"That patch [commit 6077c2d706] can be considered as a first step that
can be refined further, namely by modifying the dm-rq code further such
that dm-rq queues are only rerun after the busy condition has been
cleared. The patch at the start of this thread is easier to review and
easier to test than any patch that would only rerun dm-rq queues after
the busy condition has been cleared."

Do you have time to reason through Bart's previous proposal for how to
better address the specific issue that was documented to be fixed in the
header for commit 6077c2d706 ?

Otherwise I fear we'll just keep hitting a wall with Bart...

Thanks,
Mike
