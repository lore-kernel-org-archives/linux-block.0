How accurate it this?  For example, the changes to
generic_file_direct_write() appear to greatly reduce the chances of
blocking but there are surely race opportunities which will still
result in userspace unexpectedly experiencing blocking in a succeednig
write() call?

If correct then I think there should be some discussion and perhaps
testing results in the changelog.


I have only minor quibbles - I'll grab the patch series for some -next
testing (at least).
