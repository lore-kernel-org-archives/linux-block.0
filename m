Yeap, definitely was incorrect.  I've dropped the patch.

Yes, I see that now.

I think Zdenek triggered a false-positive that DM had magically sprouted
a new "bioset" rescue_workqueue.  Reality is I cannot see how each
bio-based DM device can avoid having one.  And the commit d67a5f4b59
("dm: flush queued bios when process blocks to avoid deadlock") I
referenced earlier very much makes DM depend on it even more.

So apologies for being so off-base (by looking to prematurely revert
DM's use of BIOSET_NEED_RESCUER, etc).

I'll very likely pick these up for 4.16 shortly.  But hope to work
through complete removal of DM's use of BIOSET_NEED_RESCUER for 4.16 as
well.

This one [1] needs a lot of review and testing.  Particularly against this
test case that Mikulas created to reproduce the snapshot deadlock (same
deadlock that motivated commit dbba42d8):

Wish I could clone myself (or Kent, the world needs 2 Kents!) and pursue
this: https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2014-May/msg00100.html

Short of that, how would you like to proceed?

Should we work to make [1] (above) sure it fixes Mikulas' test case?

I'll set in on reviewing and playing with [1] now.

Thanks,
Mike
