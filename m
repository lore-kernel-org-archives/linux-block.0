Yep, but since max_sectors_kb is a performance tunable and not something
enforced by the hardware, maybe we should consider treating it
differently?

That's fine. Another option would be to use the max_dev_sectors queue
limit to contain the minimum max_sectors from below. It was really only
envisioned as a LLD limit but it may be useful in this case.
queue_max_sectors_store() already enforces it.
