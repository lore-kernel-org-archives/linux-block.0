I am not - we used to have this elevator change functionality from
inside the kernel, and finally got rid of it when certain drivers killed
it. I don't want to be bringing it back.

Sounds like we have two issues here. One is that we run into issues with
stacking IO schedulers, and the other is that we'd rather not have
multiple schedulers in play for a stacked setup.

Maybe it'd be cleaner to have the dm-mq side of things not insert
through the scheduler, but rather just FIFO on the target end?
