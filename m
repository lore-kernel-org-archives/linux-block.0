That's strange-- are you doing the same test scenario?  How much
random I/O did you ask for?

My tests took 6-7 minutes to do the 30G of 8k not-repeating I/Os in a
30G file (about 9k IOPs for me-- it's actually significantly faster
but then starves every few seconds-- not new with these patches)..
your cache device if 3.8T, so to have a similar 12-13% of the cache
you'd need to do 15x as much (90 mins if you're the same speed--- but
your I/O subsystem is also much faster...)

If you're doing more like 3.8T of writes--  note that's not the same
test.  (It will result in less contiguous stuff in the cache and it
will be less repeatable / more volatile).
