Rui Hua--

Thanks for the clarification.  You're correct, it doesn't get called,
and it goes to read_complete.  However, read_error should probably get
called.  How would you suggest handling this-- should we initially set
read_dirty_data true and clear it if it is all clean?  (and change the
condition to properly go into the error path).  As it is, the patch
makes things no worse but the error path is very unsafe.
