Subject: [PATCH v3 00/12] block: always associate blkg and refcount cleanup
Date: Tue, 11 Sep 2018 14:41:25 -0400
Message-Id: <20180911184137.35897-1-dennisszhou@gmail.com>

Hi everyone,

v3: a few minor fixes.
  0003: Updated the comment to bio_associate_blkg to reflect closest
        association.
        Removed a return branch in __bio_lookup_create.
  0009: Removed an unnecessary rcu_read_(un)lock pair.
  0010: Fixed blkg null pointer... blkg->blkcg => blkcg.

This is rebased onto axboe#for-4.20/block 902d53914f64.

>From v2 below (updated):
------
This is a followup to the patch series I sent out earlier [1] containing
the middle two points:
  1. always associate a bio with a blkg
  2. remove the extra css ref held by bios and utilize the blkg ref

The major difference with v2 is that error handling on blkg creation
and association failure is handled more gracefully. Rather than having
the complex logic to fallback to root, failures walk up the blkg tree.
This seems more natural and less prone to error with the many possible
failure scenarios.

Additionally, there are fixes for kbuild errors and some key details
overlooked by me in the first series that were pointed out in review.

Modified from the first patchset:
First, both blk-throttle and blk-iolatency rely on blkg association
to enable their policies. Rather than each policy (and future policies)
implement this logic independently, this consolidates it such that
all bios are tagged with a blkg.

Second, with the addition of always having a blkg reference, the blkcg
can now be referenced through it rather than maintaining an additional
pointer and reference. So let's clean this up.
