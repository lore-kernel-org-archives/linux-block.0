Yes, I read the code again, it's true that hash-search begin with the first
bucket, so it's OK when circular buffer has wrapped, but another scenario:
NNNYYYY, I think the last bucket would be lost, since it would get the 7th bucket
as an invalid bucket (due to return value of 
find_next_bit(bitmap, ca->sb.njournal_buckets, l + 1)), and would read journal 
start with the 6th bucket in reverse order, how do you think about?

As I see, this scenario is OK, because in the step 2, it will try to get the third
bucket, and then read journal form the second bucket, so no invalid bucket reading 
across would happen, the reason is in step 2, these buckets after the third bucket 
can not satisfy the condition:
if (seq != list_entry(list->prev, struct journal_replay,list)->j.seq)
so it would get the third bucket as an invalid bucket, and the second bucket as the
latest valid bucket.

Thanks,
