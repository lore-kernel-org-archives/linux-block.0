The merge window opens when Linus releases the previous kernel. So you
have to try and keep track of when he expects to do that. That really
isn't that difficult - Linus always cuts a release on Sundays. We always
have 7 or 8 rc releases, so a good time to check is his mail on -rc6 or
-rc7 release, that usually gives a good indication of when he expects to
release the final.

To keep things simple, if you always have things ready when -rc7 is
released, then you are at least one week out from the merge window,
possibly two if we end up doing an -rc8. That means you don't have to
track anything, you know the exact date of when -rc7 is released since
Linus's schedule is usually reliable.
