Hi Mike,

I feel uncomfortable with this patch, can you help me to double check ?

In my patch, I set task state to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE after checking the
following conditions,
469	if (!atomic_read(&dc->has_dirty) ||
470	    (!test_bit(BCACHE_DEV_DETACHING, &dc->disk.flags) &&
471	     !dc->writeback_running)) {

And set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE) is after
up_write(&dc->writeback_lock), there should be a potential race window
between up_write() and set_current_state() in my patch. If
wake_up_process(dc->writeback_thread) is called in this window, and then
current state is set to TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE again, writeback thread will
lose a chance to be waken up.

It seems I need to call set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE) before
up_write(&dc->writeback_lock), then dc->writeback_lock will protect and
avoid the race. Or move set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE) to the
location before the condition checks in line 469-471.

This race window is very small but I believe it exists, I will fix it in
v2 patch set.

Thanks.

Coly Li
