Hi Mike,

I've reviewed the series and I support with the goal. I'm not a big fan,
though, of having yet-another-field to set in bio and req on each IO.

Unless I'm missing something, I think we can make this simpler if you add
the new 'failover_req_fn' as an attribute of the struct request_queue
instead of threading it through bio and request. Native nvme multipath
can set the field directly in the nvme driver, and dm-mpath can set it
in each path when not using the nvme mpath. What do you think?
