That isn't true, when BLK_STS_RESOURCE is returned to blk-mq, blk-mq
will apply BLK_MQ_S_SCHED_RESTART to hold the queue until one in-flight
request is completed, please see blk_mq_sched_restart() which is called
from blk_mq_free_request().

Also now we have IO schedulers, when blk_get_request() in dm-mpath returns
NULL, it doesn't provide underlying queue's BUSY accurately or in time, since
at default size of scheduler tags is double size of driver tags. So it isn't
good to depend blk_get_request() only to evaluate queue's busy status, this
patchset provides underlying's dispatch result directly to blk-mq, and can deal
with this case much better.

Again, queue won't be rerun immediately after STS_RESOURCE is returned to
blk-mq. And BLK_MQ_S_SCHED_RESTART should address your concern on continuous
resubmission in case of running out of requests, right?

Thanks,
