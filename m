That is your idea.  In the end there have been a lot of complains about
dm-multipath, and there was a lot of discussion how to do things better,
with a broad agreement on this approach.  Up to the point where Hannes
has started considering doing something similar for scsi.

And to be honest if this is the tone you'd like to set for technical
discussions I'm not really interested.  Please calm down and stick
to a technical discussion.
