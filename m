Subject: [PATCH V6 07/18] blk-throttle: make sure expire time isn't too big

cgroup could be throttled to a limit but when all cgroups cross high
limit, queue enters a higher state and so the group should be throttled
to a higher limit. It's possible the cgroup is sleeping because of
throttle and other cgroups don't dispatch IO any more. In this case,
nobody can trigger current downgrade/upgrade logic. To fix this issue,
we could either set up a timer to wakeup the cgroup if other cgroups are
idle or make sure this cgroup doesn't sleep too long. Setting up a timer
means we must change the timer very frequently. This patch chooses the
latter. Making cgroup sleep time not too big wouldn't change cgroup
bps/iops, but could make it wakeup more frequently, which isn't a big
issue because throtl_slice * 8 is already quite big.
