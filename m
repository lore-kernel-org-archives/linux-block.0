I missed this line of work until now.  Not quite sure why I wasn't
cc'd or my review/ack required for the DM changes in this patchset.

But I've now queued this patch for once Linus gets back (reverts DM
changes from commit 47e0fb461f):
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/commit/?h=for-next&id=c9fdc42ba23eabd1ba7aef199fb9bb4b4fe5c545

As is, it is my understanding that DM has no need for a bio_set's
rescue_workqueue.  So its removal would appear to only be gated by
bcache?

But I could be mistaken, moving forward please let me know what you
feel needs doing in DM to make it a better citizen.

Thanks,
Mike
