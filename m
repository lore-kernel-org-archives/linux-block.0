I noticed you add "closure_sync(&cl)" before assigning delay to zero in your patch, 
I think we should add it before:
delay = writeback_delay(dc, size)
otherwise we would alays get a wrong value of delay after calling writeback_delay(), 
since the write-back IO is just sended out and not finished yet.

Am I right?
