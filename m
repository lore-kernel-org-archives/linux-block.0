Hello Mikulas,

Sorry if I wasn't clear enough. What I meant is to wait until all 
outstanding requests have finished before modifying the 
discard_zeroes_data flag - the kind of operation that is performed by 
e.g. blk_mq_freeze_queue(). Modifying the discard_zeroes_data flag after 
a bio has been submitted and before it has completed could lead to 
several classes of subtle bugs. Functions like __blkdev_issue_discard() 
assume that the value of the discard_zeroes_data flag does not change 
after this function has been called and before the submitted requests 
completed.

Bart.
