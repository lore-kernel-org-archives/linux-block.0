I think it was my commit 721c7fc701c7 ("block: fail op_is_write()
requests to read-only partitions").  The block layer was previously
allowing non-blkdev_write_iter() writes to read-only disks and
partitions.  dm's chunk_io() boils down to submit_bio(), so in 4.16
it started to fail if the underlying device was marked read-only.

Apparently at least some versions of lvm(8) instruct dm to mark the COW
device read-only even though it is always written to.  It comes up only
if the user asks for a read-only snapshot (the default is writable).

One option might be to ignore the supplied DM_READONLY_FLAG for COW
devices.  Marking the COW device (i.e. the exception store) read-only
is probably never sane...

Thanks,
