So you mean checking css->refcnt to prevent the further use of
blkg_get? I think it makes sense.
IMO, we should use css_tryget_online instead, and rightly after taking
queue_lock. Because there may be more use of blkg_get in blk_throtl_bio
in the futher. Actually it already has two now. One is in
blk_throtl_assoc_bio, and the other is in throtl_qnode_add_bio.
What do you think of this?

Thanks,
Joseph
