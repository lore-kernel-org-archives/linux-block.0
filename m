If you can go to multiple devices, obviously it should not block on a
single device. That's only true for the case where you can only go to
one device, blocking at that point would probably be fine. Or if all
your paths are busy, then blocking would also be OK.

But it's a much larger change, and would entail changing more than just
the actual call to blk_get_request().

There are many ways it could be setup - just partition the underlying
device then, and have one partition be part of the dm setup and the
other used directly.

Yeah, we need the quick and dirty sooner, which just brings us back to
what we had before, essentially.
