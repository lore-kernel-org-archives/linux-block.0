Thank you for your quick respond, It's true that open_buckets are only for 
allocations and writes to the SSD, but in writeback mode, data from flash 
devices and backend bcache devices are all write to bucket(SSD). This patch add 
a separate open bucket list for flash devices, so data from flash devices 
and backend bcache devices can store in different buckets. 

Thanks,
Tang
