The scary case is when filesystem data that points to other filesystem
data is cached.  E.g. the data structures representing what space is
free on disk, or a directory, or a database btree.  Some examples:

Free space handling-- if a big file /foo is created, and the active
free-space datastructures are in cache (and this is likely, because
actively written places can have their writeback-writes
cancelled/deferred indefinitely)-- and then later the caching disk
fails, an old version of this will be read from disk.  Later, an
effort to write a file /bar allocates the space used by /foo, and
writes over it.

Directory entity handling-- if /var/spool/foo is an active directory
(associated data structures in cache), and has the directory
/var/spool/foo/bar under it, and then /bar is removed... the backing
disk will still have a reference to bar.  If the space for bar is then
used for something else, the kernel may end up reading something very
different from what it expects for a directory later after a cache
device failure.

Btrees, etc-- the same thing.  If a tree shrinks, old tree entitys can
end up pointing to other kinds of data.

I think this change is harmful-- it is not a good idea to
automatically, at runtime, decide to start returning data that
violates the guarantees a block device is supposed to obey about
ordering and persistence.
