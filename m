For write-around mode, there is only backing device as bdev target, it
does not have such inconsistent data issue.

And indeed, this is a try-best effort. I mean, if a cached device is
changed from writeback mode to writethrough mode, then the cache device
is offline with dirty data, data corruption will still be probably to
happen. Anyway, this patch fixes most of cases when people do not change
cache mode in runtime.

Thanks.
