Yes, I am also testing it from my side, and after v2 patches (I will
rebase the rested patches agains bcache-for-next) our partners will join
the verification too.

Thanks for doing this. When you test the patch set, please apply them
together, because the bugs that the first 8 patches try to fix won't be
triggered without applying the last 2 patches, especially the io_disable
patch.

The io_disable patch fixes dc->count reference issue, then
cache_set_flush() can be executed, and the bugs are triggered.

No rush, I am glad to review the patches once they are done.

Thanks for your effort, again :-)
