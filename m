That is *not* how kernel development is supposed to work. If your
script used to work, it should continue to work.

Why did it use to work despite that read-only flag? And what was it
that actually broke this?

We remain bug-for-bug compatible with older kernel versions when
people depend on the bugs. Unless the old bugs are security issues,
and even then we try to make it _look_ like we work the same way.

Or was it a user-space lvm tool that broke in the first place, and the
kernel release update was a red herring?
