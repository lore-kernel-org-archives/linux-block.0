And yet Laurence cannot reproduce any such lockups with your test...

Are you absolutely certain this patch doesn't help you?
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10174037/

If it doesn't then that is actually very useful to know.

You have no self-awareness of just how mypoic you're being about this.

I'm not ignoring or blaming you for your test no longer passing.  Far
from it.  I very much want to fix this.  But I want it fixed in a way
that doesn't paper over the real bug(s) while also introducing blind
queue runs that compromise the blk-mq RESTART code's ability to work as
intended.

I'd have thought you could appreciate this.  We need a root cause on
this, not hand-waving justifications on why problematic delayed queue
runs are correct.

Please just focus on helping Laurence get his very capable testbed to
reproduce this issue.  Once we can reproduce these "unkillable" "stalls"
in-house it'll be _much_ easier to analyze and fix.

Thanks,
Mike
