BTW, while I conceded "Fine": I think your justification for not
reintroducing elevator_change() lacks substance.  What is inherently
problematic about elevator_change()?

Having an elevator attached to a DM multipath device's underlying path's
request_queue just asks for trouble (especially given the blk-mq
elevator interface).

Please own this issue as a regression and help me arrive at a timely way
forward.

Thanks,
Mike
