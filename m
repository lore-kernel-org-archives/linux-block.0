Nobody ever said there wasn't breakage.  And yes, Zdenek papered over
the regression introduced by commit 721c7fc701c71 in userspace (lvm2)
rather than sound the alarm that the kernel regressed.

We clearly _do_ regress.  Hence this thread.

It isn't.

But you're tearing the head off of a userspace developer (Zdenek).

As I explained to Ted in my previous reply to this thread: using an lvm2
that is of the same vintage of the kernel is generally going to provide
a more robust user experience (fixes, features, etc have been
introduced).  But both lvm2 and dm strive to never break users -- just
like the rest of Linux.

Anyway, what would you like done about this block regression?  The
dm-snapshot use-case isn't compelling because it impacts 2 users (that
we know of) but there could be other scenarios (outside of DM) that
could impact more -- though you'd think we'd have heard about them by
now.

Do you want to revert 4.16's commit 721c7fc701c71 ?
