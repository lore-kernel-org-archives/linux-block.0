Hello Jens,

FWIW I'd like to support Coly by reporting that patches 0001, 0002, 0006 
and 0013 (the last one mentioned above) have been tested by me on 2 
production servers with a good deal of bcache activity for the last 6 
weeks without any issues having arisen.

But this may not be much use to you to know, as these are running 
vanilla kernel.org kernel 4.4.77.  Still, these 4 patches exactly as 
Coly has sent them to you apply without any changes to the code, so I 
guess it vouches for the code at least somewhat.

Eddie
