So much "yes"!!
Just a notifier chain would probably do.

I would like the notification to support changing the size of the device
too.
I see this as being two-stage.
1/ I'm going to change the device size to X - are you all OK with that?
2/ Device size is now X.

That allows md and dm to check that filesystems aren't going to get mad
when devices are made smaller, and can adjust (if they want to) when
devices get bigger.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
