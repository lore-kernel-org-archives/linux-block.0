Thanks for the detailed information. I come to understand :-)

For writing case, I agree that metadata should be kept in cache device.
For reading case, there is a special case for gfs2. gfs2 sets
(REQ_RAHEAD | REQ_META) both for meta data read ahead code path, all
other file systems use (REQ_META | REQ_PRIO) when doing metadata read
ahead. I don't know whether this is something should be fixed in gfs2,
but currently maybe we should also check REQ_META,

+ /* if the read ahead request is for metadata, don't skip it */
+ if ((bio->bi_opf & (REQ_RAHEAD|REQ_BACKGROUND)) &&
+     !(bio->bi_opf & REQ_META))
+ 	goto skip;

At least we can avoid a potential performance regression here.

And could you please add the above information in patch comments.

Thank you in advance.
