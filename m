Hi Pavel,

I don't like "auto" since its behavior is unpredictable, sometimes whole
things are gone, sometimes bcache device exists but slower, for large
scale deployed environment, it is confused and misleading.

After thinking for a while, I feel the "auto"/"always" options can make
both enterprise and home users get an agreement. I am not able to find
other better solution so far, thank you for the hint, brilliant!

Personally I intend to set "always" as the default option, because I
maintain bcache for enterprise workloads. The persistent option problem
pointed by you does make sense, I will think how to solve it later
(probably from user space tools).

How do you think of this ?
