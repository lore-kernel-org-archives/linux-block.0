True, the tested use cases were based  on backing filesystems
w/o direct I/O support which is valuable to me.

As a quick test I opened the backing file O_DIRECT in dm-loop on XFS 
backed by
NVMe and it's 10-20% slower than loop because it's bio based and thus 
lags mq.

So, no worries, loop looks ok in regards to direct I/O mode.
