Hello Bart Thank you.

OK, so booting into Mike tree now and then hopefully I get the lockups.
Can you give me some idea of what to look for.
I assume I/O just stops.

I want to get this happening in-house so we have an avenue to fix this.
Following getting the stall I will attend to the slg patch test for the
SRPT side.

Please note I am not running latest SRPT right now as you know.

Regards
Back later with results
