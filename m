Hello Bart
I have run a good few loops of 02-mq and its stable for me on your
tree.
I am not running the entire disconnect re-connect loops and un-mounts
etc. for good reason.
I have 35 LUNS so its very impact-full to lose them and have them come
back all the time.

Anyway
I am very happy to try reproduce this in-house so Mike and Ming can
focus on it but I need to know if all I need to do is loop over 02-mq
over and over.

Also please let me know whats debugfs and sysfs to capture and I am
happy to try help move this along.

Regards
Laurence
