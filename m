This is wrong.  Else we'd never make it back to the target.

No, utilizing less of disk throughput for a given writeback rate
improves workload latency.  :P  The maximum that will be aggregated in
this way is constrained more strongly than the old code...

Nope.  It lowers disk utilization overall, and the amount of disk
bandwidth any individual request chunk can use is explicitly bounded
(unlike before, where it was not).

The less writeback seeks the disk, the more the real workload can seek
this disk!  And if you're at high writeback rates, the vast majority
of the time the disk is seeking!

We have a subsystem in place to rate-limit and make sure that they are
not issued continuously!  If you want to preserve good latency for
userspace, you want to keep the system in the regime where that
control system is effective!

No... this doesn't change the consistency properties.  I am just
saying-- if we have (up to 5 contiguous things that we're going to
write back), wait till they're all read; plug; dispatch writes ;
unplug.

Thankfully we'll have 5 things to fire immediately after each other,
so we don't need to worry about automatic unplug.

I disagree!

Bcache already implements a (one-way) elevator!  Bcache invests
**significant effort** already to do writebacks in LBA order (to
effectively short-stroke the disk), but because of different arrival
times of the read request they can end up reordered.  This is bad.
This is a bug.
