Hi Jens,

This series is not planned but necessary. The four patches from me fix
a bcache super block layout issue which was introduced in 5.9 when large
bucket (32MB-1TB size for zoned device) feature firstly introduced.

Previous code has problem on space consumption and checksum calculation.
These four patches improve and fix the problems with on-disk format
consistency. Although now almost no one (except me) uses the large
bucket code now, it should be good to have the fix as soon as possible.

This series also has a patch from Yi Li which avoid a redundant value
assignment in a two-level loop. It is cool if we may have it in 5.11.

User space bcache-tools are updated for the above kernel changes too.
Please take them for 5.11-rc3.

Thanks in advance.

Coly Li
