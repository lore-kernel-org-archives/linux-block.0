I don't know.

IMO, we can't just remove it because it is a bio based driver, the
bounce is not related with
a bio or req based driver, and it depends if the controller can handle
highmem page.

Actually the bounce for highmem is here from v2.6.12, and looks you
might need to
investigate why it is introduced from start before the removing, :-)



Thanks,
