I fail to see how this is a "workaround".  Whatever you call it, the
blk-throttle code needs to cope with the fact that DM's request_queue
setup is different than other block devices.

If having DM call a function that blk-throttle provides (code that is in
block/blk-throttle.c) I fail to see the layer violation.  No more a
layer violation than any of the other block core code that block drivers
call to setup the request_queue's capabilities.

But I'm not well-versed on blk-throttle code (hence DM coming up lacking
relative to it).  SO I'll defer to you guys to sort it out how you think
best.

Thanks,
Mike
