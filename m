Sleep helped.  I had another look and it is only the old .request_fn
blk_get_request() code that even sets -ENODEV (if blk_queue_dying).

But thankfully the blk_get_request() error handling in
multipath_clone_and_map() checks for blk_queue_dying() and will return
DM_MAPIO_DELAY_REQUEUE.

So we're all set for this case.
