Hi Mike,

I am testing all the 5 patches these days for the writeback performance.
I just find when dirty number is much smaller then dirty target,
writeback rate is still maximum as 488.2M/sec.

Here is part of the output:

rate:		488.2M/sec
dirty:		91.7G

The backing cached device size is 7.2TB, cache device is 1.4TB, block
size is 8kB only. I write 700G (50% of cache device size) dirty data
onto the cache device, and start writeback by echo 1 to
writeback_running file.

In my test, writeback spent 89 minutes to decrease dirty number from
700G to 147G (dirty target number is 152G). At this moment writeback
rate was still displayed as 488.2M/sec. And after 22 minutes writeback
rate jumped to 4.0k/sec. During the 22 minutes, (147-15.8=) 131.2G dirty
data written out.

Is it as expected ?

Thanks.
