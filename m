Sure, I've done that now.

Hmm yes, that could happen with a malicious app.

For non-file using opcodes, I think we should just error the sqe if we
have req->rw.ki_filp set. That shouldn't happen unless the app is doing
something funky. I'll fix this.

The matching read barrier is in the application, it must do that before
reading ->head for the SQ ring.

For the other barrier, since the ring->r.head now has a READ_ONCE(),
that should be all we need to ensure that loads are done.

That won't work since we use ->user for other items later on. But I can
store whether we need it or not, I'll do that.
