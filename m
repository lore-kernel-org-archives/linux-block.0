Hi,

Yes, I had concerns about this.  But that theory is for a fully formed
disk (one that has a request_queue attached to disk->queue).  So far my
testing of these changes with DM (using various testsuites) hasn't
encountered _any_ problems.

But please try to break it... ;)
I have the changes in a git branch here:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/snitzer/linux.git/log/?h=block-4.16

Not sure how that is a related issue to this thread.
But can you expand on that?  I'm not familiar with "blk-mq debugfs".
Any pointer to code that activates it?  Could be that my changes make it
work now...

As I explained in the header (quoted above actually) it is _not_
possible.  It is the gendisk that enables the device stack to be
constructed (at least how DM's stacking is currently implemented with
bd_link_disk_holder() and taking references on devices found in a DM
device's table).  And from that gendisk I can then walk the devices to
establish the request_queue as needed, its stacked limits, etc.

The approach I've taken in these patches is the closest I've gotten to
make DM _much_ more sane about how its request_queue is established.
But its still off the beaten path due to needing "block: cope with
gendisk's 'queue' being added later".

Mike
