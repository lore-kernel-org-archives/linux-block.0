So configure q->rq_timeout to be shorter?  Which is configurable though
blk_mq_tag_set's 'timeout' member.  It apparently defaults to 30 * HZ.

That is the problem with timeouts, there is generally no one size fits
all.

Hard to know it is only DM's blk-mq that is impacted.  That is the only
blk-mq driver that you're testing like this (that is also able to handle
faults, etc).

Because your "much simpler" fix actively hurts performance, as is
detailed in this header:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/commit/?h=dm-4.16&id=ec3eaf9a673106f66606896aed6ddd20180b02ec

I'm not going to take your bandaid fix given it very much seems to be
papering over a real blk-mq issue.
