That's a valid question, was going to ask that too. But I assumed that Brian
used submit_queues to set as many queues as he has logical CPUs in the system.

It means either 1 null_blk device, 80 threads running IO to it. Or 80 null_blk
devices, each with a thread running IO to it. See above, he details that it's
80 threads on 80 devices for that case.
