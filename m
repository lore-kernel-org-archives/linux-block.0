'Staled' is not a word, though perhaps it should be. You probably want
to call it recovery_from_stale_data. But given the description below...

... this name is also unclear. It sounded to me like it was an option
that recovers *from* stale data (as if the stale data was a problem to
recover from), not an option that uses stale data to *allow* recovery.

Perhaps, instead, something like stale_data_permitted or
allow_stale_data_on_failure would be better?
