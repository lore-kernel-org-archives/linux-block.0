Not sure why the md/raid0 device would need to do anything (not unless
it wanted to take advantage of this).

The model, in my head, would be that this is _not_ intended for an
arbitrary stacked MD or DM device.  So the underlying device(s) for
a DM or MD device, that wants to leverage upper layer bio_set provided
front_pad, would be a real device (e.g. NVMe, SCSI, whatever).

But if a mix of underlying drivers were used (each with unique
per-bio-data, aka front_pad, requirements) then the blk_stack_limits()
interface _could_ build that information up.  And while that pretty much
gets us all we'd need to support md/raid0 on arbitrary stacked DM or MD
volumes that isn't what I'm interested in.  But supporting an arbitrary
stacked device could be done as follow-on work.

I'm specifically looking to optimize DM's new DM_TYPE_NVME_BIO_BASED
device (see commits 22c11858e, 978e51ba3, cd02538445, etc) so that bios
are just remapped to the underlying NVMe device without cloning.  DM
core now takes care to validate that a DM_TYPE_NVME_BIO_BASED DM device
(e.g. a DM multipath device -- via "queue_mode nvme") is _only_ stacked
directly ontop of native NVMe devices.

Yes

Yes and no, the driver really should be able to trust that the block
layer is sending it bios with adeuqate front_pad (if the device
registered its front_pad requirements).

That said, making it optional (via "hint") is likely safer from the
standpoint that it is less cut-throat given we'd be depending on the
various biosets to respect our wishes.  I just worry that having the
code for falling back to cloning, if the front_pad isn't adequate, will
defeat much of the benefit of optimizing what is intended to be a faster
fast path.

But if the bioset enhancements are implemented properly then the kernels
N biosets shouldn't need to be in doubt.  They'll all just adapt to have
N backing mempools (N being for N conflicting front_pad requirements).

s/preferred/required/ in my mental model.

You're referring to he notifier chain idea about restacking
queue_limits?  Yes, that'd be needed once that exists.

This shouldn't be needed if we were to go the route where bio_sets
dynamically select the appropriate mempool based on the front_pad
requirements advertised by the underlying device ("3/" above).

Thanks,
