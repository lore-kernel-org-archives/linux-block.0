Yeah, if we decide to take the approach of introducing NO_DEV_RESOURCE, all
the current STS_RESOURCE for non-device resource allocation(kmalloc, dma
map, get_request, ...) should be converted to NO_DEV_RESOURCE.

And it is a generic issue, which need generic solution.

Seems running queue after arbitrary in this case is the only way we
thought of, or other solutions?

If the decision is made, let's make/review the patch, :-)
