Good question.  I don't remember having a good reason to choose it, and
if there was one I suspect I would have mentioned it in the commit
message.
So it was most likely an oversight.
Looking at the code now, I can see no justification for not using
bio_clone_fast() or similar.

Thanks for looking into this - I guess the next step is to get rid of
bio_clone_bioset() completely.  Nice.

I agree with the patch.
