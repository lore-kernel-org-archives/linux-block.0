I will write a test bench and send results soon.

Just please note-- you've crafted a test where there's not likely to
be sequential data to writeback, and chosen a block size where there
is limited difference between sequential and nonsequential writeback.
Not surprisingly, you don't see a real difference with code that is
trying to optimize sequential writeback :P
