What we are discussing is more then the original patch, now the topic
changes to how handling cache device disconnection more properly. So I
change email thread subject.

I think you are correct. Your question notices me, that it is still
possible that user switches cache mode more then once as they want,
maybe some sequence like this,
 writeback -> writethrough -> none -> writeback -> none ....
So we should always check whether dirty map exists or clean, no matter
what current cache mode is.

Nice hint :-)

What I worried here is, the lost dirty data blocks is probably to have
inter-dependency, e.g. file system metadata (maybe database transaction
records).

If the cache device disconnected and a single overlapped dirty block is
permitted to go into backing device. It may cause a more worse metadata
corruption and data lose on backing device.

The root cause is, once a metadata in memory is written into bcache, its
page cache is not diry any more and probably to be released. Then cache
device disconnected and an overlapped metadata write happens, there is
no way to keep or recovery data consistent. The best method in my brain
is: don't touch it.

For clean data lost, this is totally correct. For dirty data lost, it
might not be always correct. At least for writeback mode, this recovery
logic is buggy. Return a corrupted/stale data in silence is disaster,
this logic should be fixed.

For SSD, especially industry level NVMe SSD, there are quite a lot
redundant capacity inside. If an internal storage unit failed, SSD
controller will recovery the broken unit by map its LBA to another
internal storage unit. Which means if we encounter consistent bad block
on NVMe SSD, this is an important warning, because this device has no
internal space to remap and will die very soon.

5 years ago, I know some PCIe SSDs had 30%~50% capacity more internally
for better write performance (more space to avoid synchronized garbage
collection). If a bad block returned from such SSD, the situation is
similar to a hard disk reports 25%~30% sectors are bad. Definitely
people should replace the SSD as soon as possible.

For any storage system, data health is always first priority. Providing
corrupted data is unacceptable.

If bcache cannot recovery a correct data, returning a stale data by
recovery is insane from view of users, we should not make it happen.

But if people use bcache to accelerate applications on laptop with cheap
SSD, they care about performance much more then data consistency. And
this kind of use case should represent most of bcache development in the
world. Hmm, I cannot find a way to refute you... you are right, this
should default on.

How about this,
we make this configure default on, and explain in code and document why
it exists and in which condition it should be disabled. Then people may
disable it when they seriously cares about data consistency.

Do you think it is reasonable ?

Sure, if we set recovery_io_error default on, its behavior should be
expect like this.

After a page cache is synced to underlying storage media, it is set to
clean, and can be reclaim any time by memory manage code. Then we don't
have in-memory copy to recovery.

The situation is, the data block is considered clean in memory, clean in
backing device, and dirty in cache device. If cache device disconnected,
we only know a specific dirty data lost, and no cheap way to recovery it
from memory.

This is why I proposed to return -EIO immediately if recovery_io_error=1.

Yes, your suggestion is great, let's set recovery_io_error=1 as default.

>From the above discussion, if:
- recovery_io_error=1 is set as default.
- dirty map should still be check in "non" mode (this is any mode that
you suggested), and handled properly.
do you think there is any thing more to fix on my proposal ?

Thanks for all the hints!
