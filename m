We discovered this by noticing that bcache never receives bios marked with 
ioprios that were submitted for writing by dm-crypt, but this seems to be 
an issue with dm-crypt specifically. Bcache gets ioprio information from 
upper-level drivers submitting from the original process context just 
fine. If the information is lost to bcache, it is certainly lost to the IO 
scheduler. Of course if ioprios are mapped between processes in some other 
way that I am missing, then please point that out for me.

Interestingly, before bio_ioprio was split out from bi_rw in about 
4.2-4.4, dm-crypt reads were marked fine because they do not usually get 
punted to another thread and complete from the submitting process. After 
splitting bi_ioprio out of bi_rw, reads broke because the simple cloning 
assignment of dst_bio->bi_rw = src_bio->bi_rw loses the priority bits. Of 
course this continues now that bi_rw has been pulled and changed into 
bi_opf.

I suspect there are other places where bi_rw assignments lost bi_ioprio 
assignments long ago, and this probably needs some research and 
fixup---but that is a separate issue from the dm-crypt issue.

You would probably need to modify dm-crypt just before it calls 
generic_make_request on the way out of writing bio's after encrypting 
either in kcryptd_crypt_write_io_submit or dmcrypt_write and calling 
something like WARN_ONCE if ioprio_valid(bio_prio(bio)).

Then set your IO priority using ionice on some process writing with direct 
IO to the mapper device and see if you get any warnings:
	ionice -c3 dd bs=1 of=/dev/mapper/cryptotest if=/dev/zero oflag=direct count=1

My guess is that you will not since bios are cloned without copying ioprio 
information and submitted from processes different from those of the 
calling thread.

I am curious what you find on your end, please let me know if you have any 
questions and thank you for your help!
