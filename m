You don't know that. If the resource is very limited, or someone else
is gobbling up all of it, then it may trigger quite often. Granted,
in that case, you need some way of signaling the freeing of those
resources to make it efficient.

I think it's overly complicated. As I wrote in a lengthier email earlier
today, just ensure that we have a unique return code from the driver for
when it aborts queuing an IO due to a resource shortage that isn't tied
to it's own consumption of it. When we get that return, do a delayed
queue run after X amount of time to ensure we always try again. If you
want to get fancy (later on), you could track the frequency of such
returns and complain if it's too high.

There's no point in adding a lot of code to check whether we need to run
the queue or not. Just always do it. We won't be doing it more than 100
times per second for the worst case of the condition taking a while to
clear, if we stick to the 10ms re-run time.
