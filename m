Given that Ming's notifier-based patchset needs more development time I
think we're unfortunately past the point where we can comfortably wait
for that to be ready.

So we need to explore alternatives to fixing this IO stall regression.
Rather than attempt the above block reverts (which is an incomplete
listing given newer changes): might we develop a more targeted code
change to neutralize commit 396eaf21ee ("blk-mq: improve DM's blk-mq IO
merging via blk_insert_cloned_request feedback")? -- which, given Bart's
findings above, seems to be the most problematic block commit.

To that end, assuming I drop this commit from dm-4.16:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/commit/?h=dm-4.16&id=316a795ad388e0c3ca613454851a28079d917a92

Here is my proposal for putting this regression behind us for 4.16
(Ming's line of development would continue and hopefully be included in
4.17):

Subject: [PATCH] block: neutralize blk_insert_cloned_request IO stall regression

The series of blk-mq changes intended to improve sequential IO
performace (through improved merging with dm-mapth blk-mq stacked on
underlying blk-mq device).  Unfortunately these changes have caused
dm-mpath blk-mq IO stalls when blk_mq_request_issue_directly()'s call to
q->mq_ops->queue_rq() fails (due to device-specific resource
unavailability).

Fix this by reverting back to how blk_insert_cloned_request() functioned
prior to commit 396eaf21ee -- by using blk_mq_request_bypass_insert()
instead of blk_mq_request_issue_directly().

In the future, this commit should be reverted as the first change in a
followup series of changes that implements a comprehensive solution to
allowing an underlying blk-mq queue's resource limitation to trigger the
upper blk-mq queue to run once that underlying limited resource is
replenished.
