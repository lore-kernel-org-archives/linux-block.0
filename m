This series introduces zoned block device support to the device mapper
infrastructure. Pathces are as follows:

- Patch 1: Add a new target type feature flag to indicate if a target type
  supports host-managed zoned block devices. This prevents using these drives
  with the current target types since none of them have the proper support
  implemented and will not operate properly with these drives.
- Patch 2: If a target device is a zoned block device, check that the range of
  LBAs mapped is aligned to the device zone size and that the device start
  offset also aligns to zone boundaries. This is necessary for zone reset and
  zone report correct execution.
- Patch 3: Check that the different target devices of a table have compatible
  zone sizes and models. This is necessary for target types that expose a zone
  model different from the underlying device.
- Patch 4: Fix handling of REQ_OP_ZONE_RESET bios
- Patch 5: Fix handling of REQ_OP_ZONE_REPORT bios
- Patch 6: Introduce a new helper function to reverse map a device zone report
  to the target LBA range
- Patch 7: Add support for host-managed zoned block devices to dm-flakey. This
  is necessary for testing file systems supporting natively these drives (e.g.
  f2fs).
- Patch 8: Add support for for zoned block devices to dm-linear. This can have
  useful applications during development and testing (e.g. allow creating
  smaller zoned devices with different combinations and positions of zones).
  There are also interesting applications for production, for instance, the
  ability to aggregate conventional zones of different drives to create a
  regular disk.
- Patch 9: Add sequential write enforcement to dm_kcopyd_copy so that
  sequential zones of a host-managed zoned block device can be specified as
  destinations.
- Patch 10: New dm-zoned target type (this was already sent for review twice).
  This resend adds modifications suggested by Hannes to implement reclaim
  using dm-kcopyd. dm-zoned depends on patch 9.

As always, comments and reviews are welcome.
