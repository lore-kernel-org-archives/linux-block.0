Subject: [PATCH] dm: don't allow ioctls to targets that don't map to whole devices
Date: Fri,  3 Feb 2017 11:06:13 +0100
Message-Id: <20170203100613.9023-1-hch@lst.de>
List-ID: <linux-block@vger.kernel.org>

.. at least for unprivilegued users.  Before we called into the SCSI
ioctl code to allow excemptions for a few SCSI passthrough ioctls,
but this is pretty unsafe and except for this call dm knows nothing
about SCSI ioctls.  As SCSI the SCSI ioctl code is made optionally
now we really don't want to drag it in for DM, and the exception is
not very useful anyway.

Signed-off-by: Christoph Hellwig <hch@lst.de>

Note: this should go into the block tree, as that's where
scsi_verify_blk_ioctl becomes optional.
