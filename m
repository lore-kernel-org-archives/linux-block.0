It is possible that the process sends never ending stream of bios (for 
example when reading linear data and using readahead), so waiting until 
there are no oustanding bios never finishes.

blk_mq_freeze_queue() works on request-based drivers, device mapper works 
with bios, so that function has no effect on device mapper device. Anyway 
- blk_mq_freeze_queue() won't stop the process that issues the I/O 
requests - it will just hold the requests in the queue and not forward 
them to the device.

There is no way to stop the process that issues the bios. We can't stop 
the process that is looping in __blkdev_issue_discard, issuing discard 
requests. All that we can do is to hold the bios that the process issued.

Device mapper can freeze the filesystem with "freeze_bdev", but...
- some filesystems don't support freeze
- if the filesystem is not directly mounted on the frozen device, but 
there is a stack of intermediate block devices between the filesystem and 
the frozen device, then the filesystem will not be frozen
- the user can open the block device directly and he won't be affected by 
the freeze

I agree. That's the topic of the discussion - that the discard_zeroes_data 
flag is unreliable and the flag should be moved to the bio.
