Correct, but md->rescued will be empty, or irrelevant.
The first section of dm_wq_work ensures ->rescued is empty.
When __split_and_process_bio() calls generic_make_request() (indirectly
through one or more targets) they will not be recursive calls,
so nothing will be added to current->bio_list[0] and nothing
will be moved to md->rescued.  Each generic_make_request() will
completely submit the request in the lower level devel.

Some other thread could call generic_make_request on this dm device and
result in bios appeared on md->rescued.  These bios could only be a
problem if something that __split_and_process_bio calls might wait for
them.  I don't think that happens (at least I don't think it should...).

bios on current->bio_list[0] are not allowed to depend on each other
except that later bios can depend on earlier bios.  They are all for a
lower-level device and should be largely independent.
The sorting that generic_make_request now does ensure that a bio for a
higher level device is never processed when a bio for a lower level
device, that it might depend on, is stuck on current->bio_list.

So I don't think there is a problem here.
Do you find this argument at all convincing?

Thanks,
NeilBrown
