As you know, the limits are stacked from the bottom-up.

Tough to do that in a race-free way when DM multipath requests are
cloned for submission to the underlying devices.

As the commit header from this thread mentioned, what I've arrived at is
to have multipathd establish a desired max_sectors_kb (if configured to
do so in multipath.conf) on the underlying paths _before_ the multipath
device is created.  Yet to check with Ben Marzinski or others but it
seems like a reasonable feature (and really the cleaniset way to deal
with this issue IMHO.. no need for lots of kernel code changes for
something so niche).
