Hi Mike,

I also feel I made mistake here. set_current_state(TASK_INTERRUPTIBLE)
must be called before the condition check, other wise there will be a
race window on task state setting. A correct fix should be setting task
state to TASK_RUNNING before calling 'return 0', or before calling
mutex_unlock(&(ca)->set->bucket_lock).

When I review the new closure_sync() patches, I feel I make mistake
here. It will be fixed in v2 patch set.

Thanks.

Coly Li
