Right, I had a look at blk-mq this afternoon and it is clear that the
current implementation of blk-mq's freeze (in terms of percpu
q->q_usage_counter dropping to zero) won't fly for the DM requeue
usecase.

I'll take a closer look at your patch next week.

The reuse of the mq_freeze_depth to achieve this quiesce/resume will
need closer review -- likely by Jens.

Yes, those are the correct hooks to place code to conditionally
short-circuit normal blk-mq operation.
