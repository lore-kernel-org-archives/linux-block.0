Sorry but we need to understand why you still need this.

The issue you say it was originally intended to fix _should_ be
addressed with this change:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/commit/?h=dm-4.16&id=4dd6edd23e7ea971efddc303f9e67eb79e95808e

So if you still feel you need to blindly kick the queue then it is very
likely a bug in blk-mq (either its RESTART hueristics or whatever
internal implementation is lacking)

Did you try Ming's RFC patch to "fixup RESTART" before resorting to the
above again?, see: https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10172315/

Thanks,
Mike
