Subject: [PATCH 0/5] blk-mq & dm: fix IO hang and deal with one performance issue
Date: Mon, 22 Jan 2018 11:35:45 +0800

Hi Jens,

This 1st patch introduces BLK_STS_DEV_RESOURCE for dealing with IO hang
when non-device resource is run out of and queue is idle, and this
approach is suggested by you.

The 2nd and 3rd patches cleans dm-rq a bit and prepares for applying
blk_get_request_notify().

The 4th patch introduces blk_get_request_notify(), still suggested by
you.

The last patch applies blk_get_request_notify() and avoids one
DM specific performance issue which is introduced by the 1st patch.

These 5 patches are against both dm(dm-4.16) and block tree(for-4.16/block).

Ming Lei (5):
  blk-mq: introduce BLK_STS_DEV_RESOURCE
  dm-rq: handle dispatch exception in dm_dispatch_clone_request()
  dm-rq: return BLK_STS_* from map_request()
  blk-mq: introduce blk_get_request_notify
  dm-mpath: use blk_mq_alloc_request_notify for allocating blk-mq req
