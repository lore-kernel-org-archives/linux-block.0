Yes, we need Bart to verify your v2 patch:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/10179945/

Bart please test this tree:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/log/?h=for-next

Please report back with your results (and include details on any changes
you make to the tree, hopefully no changes are needed).

Thanks,
Mike
