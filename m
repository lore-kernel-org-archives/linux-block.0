The bio_kmap_irq name implies it maps the whole bio, but it only maps
the current segment.  Now if there were plenty of users and it was
non-trivial we could say we should fix the name and documentation.
But given how trivial it is I'd rather have you open code it to clearly
document what you are doing.
