Hi Eric,

This is a nice idea, I also discussed with other people around me. A
reason not to choose it is, for data base applications in clustering
environment, it is not very important for dirty data lost on
disconnected from one server, because the work load can be switched to
other server and replay inside the cluster. But it is important to
detect the disconnected cache device failure as early as possible, so
the work load can be switched with less dirty data lost.

Finally I choose simply returning an -EIO to I/O requester, to make
application to know the cache not available earlier and not to introduce
more inconsistent data on backing device.
