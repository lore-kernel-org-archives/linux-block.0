You just mentioned 'This patch is inferior' and never explained my patch
is wrong, so please go ahead and show me why this patch(the post in this
thread, also the following link) is wrong.

	https://marc.info/?l=linux-block&m=150604412910113&w=2

I admit both are two ways for the issue, but I don't think my patch
is wrong. Your approach can be a very big change because .queue_rq()
will block, and I also mentioned it might cause AIO regression.

I don't understand why you say there is communication issue since
no much discussion yet in this thread.

Please see the whole discussion:
