Subject: [PATCH 02/14] block: introduce bio_issue_as_root_blkg
Date: Tue,  3 Jul 2018 11:14:51 -0400

Instead of forcing all file systems to get the right context on their
bio's, simply check for REQ_META to see if we need to issue as the root
blkg.  We don't want to force all bio's to have the root blkg associated
with them if REQ_META is set, as some controllers (blk-iolatency) need
to know who the originating cgroup is so it can backcharge them for the
work they are doing.  This helper will make sure that the controllers do
the proper thing wrt the IO priority and backcharging.
