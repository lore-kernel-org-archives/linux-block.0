Yes, this works.

BTW. write throttling still causes some performance degradation (350MB/s 
vs. 500MB/s without throttling) - should there be some logic that disables 
write throttling if no sync requests are received?

Something like - if there's sync read, enable write throttling - if there 
were no sync reads in the last 5 seconds, disable write throttling?
