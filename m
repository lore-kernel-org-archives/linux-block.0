Please note those two conversations were talking about different
controversial stuff in response to different questions from you.
There's the ordering change, which is expected to improve peak
writeback rate for small blocks.  The test scenarios we're running
right now are mostly trying to measure that.  There needs to be
relatively small I/O to see a difference-- that is, backing disk
access time needs to dominate to make a difference.

The other is the change in I/O aggregation behavior when writeback
rate is not maximum.  That's what I was discussing with the 1MB I/O
example.    Unfortunately it is difficult to craft a test scenario to
test this one, but the argument of why it is better is pretty simple:

-  It's much better to aggregate a few contiguous I/Os and issue them
together than to issue them some time apart because of rate limiting.
The new code will aggregate a limited number of contiguous writes even
if it doesn't have to, to meet rate.  That is, it's much better for
disk utilization to issue 5 256k writes that are sequential to each
other at the same time, and then delay 250ms instead of one at a time,
50ms apart.  In the first case, it might be a 7ms access + 13ms of
writing and then 230ms of sleeping (8% disk time used); in the second
case, if user I/O is seeking the disk away from where we're writing,
it'll be 5 groups of: 7ms access + 2.5ms writing and then 40.5ms of
sleeping (24% disk time used).
