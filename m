Sure. But at the same time, the "read-only" issue from a _security_
standpoint should never be about some device state.

Why? Because the Unix security rules aren't about "read-only devices".
They are about permissions, and if you don't want your users to have
write permissions to a device, then they shouldn't have those
permissions.

So the "set_disk_ro()" interface is simply not for security. Anybody
who uses it for security is seriously confused.

No, the "set_disk_ro()" interface is so that you can say "you
physically cannot write to this medium". It's meant for things like
CD-ROM devices, or for a floppy device when you notice that the
controller reports that the floppy itself is physically
write-protected.

THAT is what the new code checks for, and that is also why ignoring
the check really shouldn't be a security issue.

Because if it turns out that somebody wrote to it, and the write
succeeded, then obviously the "set_disk_ro()" usage was simply wrong.

Now, I do agree that it 100% makes sense to have a layer like md/lvm
be able to virtually mark volumes read-only. If only exactly to
emulate the "this is like a write-protected floppy or a cd-rom"
behavior.

So the DM_READONLY_FLAG makes conceptual sense.

But at the same time, if the DM_READONLY_FLAG was _wrong_, then it
also makes a ton of sense to just say "oh, it was wrong, we'll ignore
it".

Exactly because it was never supposed to be about security, and it was
about other things.

See?
