I had a "CONFIG_NVME_MULITIPATH=Y" typo in the dm-mpath.c commit that
added the CONFIG_NVME_MULTIPATH mutual exclussion in dm-4.16; so I
just dropped it via rebase.

So now the underlying nvme devices (already multipath'd by NVMe) should
be discoverable by multipathd.  Who am I to judge crack smokers?
