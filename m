Hi Junhui,

It is about an implicit and interesting ordering, a simple patch with a
lot detail behind. Let me explain why it's safe,

- cancel_delayed_work_sync() is called in bcache_device_detach() when
dc->count is 0. But cancel_delayed_work_sync() is called before
closure_put(&d->c->caching) in bcache_device_detach().

- After closure_put(&d->c->caching) called in bcache_device_detach(),
refcount of c->caching becomes 0, and cache_set_flush() set in
__cache_set_unregister() continue to execute.

- See continue_at() and closure_put_after_sub(), after c->caching
refoucnt reaches 0, and c->caching->fn gets called, closure_put(parent)
will be called. Here the parent of c->caching is c->cl, so refcount of
c->cl will reach 0, and closure_put_after_sub() will be called again for
c->cl and call its cl->fn which is cache_set_free(). It is set in
bch_cache_set_alloc().

- So before closure_put(&d->c->caching) is called in
bcache_device_detach(), cache_set_flush() in __cache_set_unregister()
won't be executed and memory of cache_set won't be freed.

Now back to delayed worker routine update_writeback_rate(), I check
c->flags inside it, in this moment cancel_delayed_work_sync() is still
waiting for update_writeback_rate() to exit, so refcount of c->caching
is still hold and cache set memory will only be freed after
cancel_delayed_work_sync() returns and refcount of c->caching dropped.

And in cached_dev_free(), bcache_device_free() and
kobject_put(&dc->disk.kobj) are called after cancel_delayed_work_sync()
returns. Therefore when update_writeback_rate() is executing and
accessing c->flgas inside, memory of cache_set, bcache_device and
cached_dev are all there.

This is why it is safe ;-)
