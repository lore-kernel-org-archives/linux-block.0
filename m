Please look at the cover letter or patch 5's commit log, it mentions that
dm-mpath over virtio-scsi is tested, and the default queue depth of virito-scsi
is 128.

I don't think this patch is related with this case, this patch just provides the
BUSY feedback from underlying queue to blk-mq via dm-rq.
