Other way around - the API should not be limited by the fact that some
smaller type was chosen for an internal structure. Hence the guard/check
should not be in rw_hint_valid, but rather around where you assign
ki_hint. If/when we do extend the read/write hints, then we'll
potentially need to bump ki_hint to accommodate it.
