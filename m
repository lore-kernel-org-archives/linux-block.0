I was merely giving context for the suggestion of keeping lvm2 updated.
Not saying it was relevant for this regression.

I was trying to give context for the "best to update lvm2 anyway"
disclaimer that was used.  Yeah, it was specious.

And Zdenek exposed way more surface area for you to attack with his
reply to this thread.  My initial response to this thread was far more
understated but was effectively: read-only dm-snapshot is rare, I'm
inclined to just let this be.

And yeah, that isn't a good excuse to ignore it but: dm-snapshot is a
steaming pile as compared to dm thin-provisioning so dm-snapshot users
who then go off the beaten path are already masochistic.  SO the 2 users
who noticed can cope..

But that too is a cop-out.

I'll have a closer look at all this.

Could be DM in general is lacking for read-only permissions when you
have complex stacking involved.

Yeap, they did.. I was unaware myself.

Agreed.

I never didn't care.  I just didn't care much.  Because "dm-snapshot".
