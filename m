Not sure how that detail is relevant to your patch?

But here are the 2 patches I posted as RFC to eliminate the restriction:
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9839565/
https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9839567/

In the end I'm not too interested in supporting blk-mq multipath ontop
of block legacy path.  But I'd revisit if hch or someone else posted the
blk-mq patch that "removed the ->complete handler" (as hch mentions in
the thread of the first patchwork patch I reference above).
