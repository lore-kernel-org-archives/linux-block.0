I did not use partitions. I was running this on a 4 socket Power 8 machine with
5 cores per socket, running with 4 threads per core, so a total of 80
logical CPUs were usable in Linux.

I was missing the fact that part_round_stats_single calls part_in_flight
and had only noticed the sysfs and procfs users of part_in_flight previously.
