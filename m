Does non mode guarantee that nothing is dirty?  I'm not convinced of that.  
I think you can set non mode with dirty blocks. (Correct me if I'm wrong 
here.)

Sure, that makes sense.

You would want to do a dirty map lookup for each IO.  How about this:

2) If in _any_ mode, and dirty map is dirty for *that specific block*:

  If WRITE request completely overlaps the dirty segment then clear 
	the dirty flag and pass through to the backing dev.
  otherwise:
    - return -EIO immediately for WRITE request
    - return -EIO immediately for READ request (*)

If the WRITE request completely overlaps the dirty segment as indicated 
from the in-memory metadata, then clear its dirty flag and write to the 
backing device.  Whatever was dirty isn't important anymore as it was 
overwritten.

Unless there is a good reason to diverge, we would want this recovery 
logic would be the same for failed IOs from an existing cachedev (eg, with 
badblocks), and for cachedevs that are altogether missing.

For #2,3, do a dirty map lookup for every IO: if the block is clean, pass 
it to the backing device.  Only -EIO if the request cannot be recovered 
(block is dirty) and invoke pr_crit_once() to notify the user.  We want 
all IO requests to succeed to the extent possible.

I think #3 is the same case as #2.  The logic is the same whether its is 
now or ever was in writeback mode, regardless of the current mode.

Resilience first!  This should default on.  

Sometimes systems run for months with bad sectors, and this case is no 
different.  Let the bcache users' IOs succeed if possible but notify them 
with pr_crit_once().

A reboot might loose data.  They could be lucky with important data in the 
page cache; notifying them without killing the device because it is dirty 
might give them a chance to do a hot backup before rebooting (or 
stop/starting bcache).

Since the dirty map is still in memory, that information is 
useful for recovery.  After a reboot the dirty map is lost---and with it 
the data about what is consistent and what is not. 

For example, if LVM snapshots sit atop of the bcache volume, then you 
could `dd` them off.  If you hit an error, you know that copy is at least 
partially inconsistent and can try an older snapshot until one is found 
which is old enough to be 100% consistent.  Without the dirty map, you 
would only be guessing at which volume is actually consistent.

Let users set recovery_io_error=0 for those who really want to fail early.
