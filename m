Hi Junhui,

dc->writeback_rate_update is a special delayed worker, it re-arms itself
to run after several seconds by,
>>     schedule_delayed_work(&dc->writeback_rate_update,
>>                   dc->writeback_rate_update_seconds * HZ);

I check the workqueue code, it seems cancel_delayed_work_sync() does not
prevent a delayed work to re-arm itself inside worker routine. And in my
test, around 5 seconds after cancel_delayed_work_sync() called, a NULL
pointer
difference oops happens. Cache set memory is freed within 2 seconds
after __cache_set_unregister() called, so inside
__update_writeback_rate() struct cache_set is referenced and causes the
NULL pointer deference bug.

There are several delayed work in bcache code, but only
dc->writeback_rate_update is special to re-arm itself.
