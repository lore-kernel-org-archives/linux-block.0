I don't like this patch at all - it's a 10 line function (if that)
that ends up with three outputs, two of them hidden in passed
in pointers. On top of that, a function that is named
__blk_mq_issue_req() and returns bool, you would logically expect
a 'true' return to mean that it succeeded. This is the opposite.

Not strongly opposed to the rest.
