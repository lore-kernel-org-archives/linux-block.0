The purpose of discard is to improve SSD performance and reduce wear.

Generating more write requests for discard does quite the opposite - it 
reduces performance (discard + two small writes is slower than just 
discard) and it also causes more wear.

The device mapper pauses all bios when it switches the table - but the bio 
was submitted with assumption that it goes to a device withe 
"discard_zeroes_data" set, then the bio is paused, device mapper table is 
switched, the bio is unpaused, and now it can go to a device without 
"discard_zeroes_data".
