OK good, I'll queue that up then.

blk-wbt maintains a baseline that isn't too deep into writes, or you run
into problems exactly when a sync or read request does come in after 5
seconds, or whatever heuristic you choose. So that's very much by
design. It does allow steps to go negative if no reads have been seen,
but only so much so, and it bounces back immediately when one is seen.
