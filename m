Hey Neil,

Good news!  All your code works ;)

(well after 1 fixup due to a cut-n-paste bug.. the code you added to
dm_wq_work() to process the md->rescued bio_list was operating on
the md->deferred bio_list due to cut-n-paste from code you copied from
just below it)

I split your code out some to make it more reviewable.  I also tweaked
headers accordingly.

Please see this branch (which _will_ get rebased between now and the
4.16 merge window):
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/device-mapper/linux-dm.git/log/?h=dm-4.16

I successfully tested these changes using Mikulas' test program that
reproduces the snapshot deadlock:
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2017-January/msg00064.html

I'll throw various other DM testsuites at it to verify they all look
good (e.g. thinp, cache, multipath).

I'm open to all suggestions about changes you'd like to see (either to
these patches or anything you'd like to layer ontop of them).

Thanks for all your work, much appreciated!
Mike
