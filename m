Hi Junhui,

Your suggest is essentially almost same to my patch,
- clear BCACHE_DEV_DETACHING bit acts as SET NO NEED RE-ARM FLAG.
- cancel_writeback_rate_update_dwork acts as some kind of locking with a
timeout.

The difference is I don't use dc->writeback_lock, and replace it by
BCACHE_DEV_RATE_DW_RUNNING.

The reason is my following development. I plan to implement a real-time
update stripe_sectors_dirty of bcache device and cache set, then
bcache_flash_devs_sectors_dirty() can be very fast and bch_register_lock
can be removed here. And then I also plan to remove reference of
dc->writeback_lock in update_writeback_rate() because indeed it is
unnecessary here (the patch is held by Mike's locking resort work).

Since I plan to remove dc->writeback_lock from update_writeback_rate(),
I don't want to reference dc->writeback in the delayed work.

The basic idea behind your suggestion and this patch, is almost
identical. The only difference might be the timeout in
cancel_writeback_rate_update_dwork().

Thanks.
