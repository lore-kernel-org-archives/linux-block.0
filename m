Would prefer to see the use of DMERR_LIMIT() or DMWARN_LIMIT() as those
wrappers provide error message consistency across DM core and DM
targets.  Also, would make sense to say: "sending ioctl %x to DM device
without required privilege (CAP_SYS_RAWIO)."

(you have a couple s/privilegue/privilege typos)

And this patch will need Paolo's ack before being staged.

Otherwise, look good:
