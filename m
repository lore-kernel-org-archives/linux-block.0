(replying to an e-mail from ten days ago)

Implementing a notification mechanism for all cases in which 
blk_insert_cloned_request() returns BLK_STS_RESOURCE today would require 
a lot of work. If e.g. a SCSI LLD returns one of the SCSI_MLQUEUE_*_BUSY 
return codes from its .queuecommand() implementation then the SCSI core 
will translate that return code into BLK_STS_RESOURCE. From scsi_queue_rq():

	reason = scsi_dispatch_cmd(cmd);
	if (reason) {
		scsi_set_blocked(cmd, reason);
		ret = BLK_STS_RESOURCE;
		goto out_dec_host_busy;
	}

In other words, implementing a notification mechanism for all cases in 
which blk_insert_cloned_request() can return BLK_STS_RESOURCE would 
require to modify all SCSI LLDs.
