I don't think it is necessary to mention that in comment log, because
one patch won't deal with all things.

But definitely there will be one patch which deals with that in V2,
otherwise the performance issue can't be solved completely.

Up to now, it is one dm-mpath specific performance issue under one
specific situation: IO is submitted to dm-mpath device and the
underlying queue at the same time, and the underlying queue depth is
very low, such as 1.

I thought no such race because the dm request is still in dispatch list before
the 'notifier' is handled. And now looks this isn't true, but this issue can be
dealt easily by call blk_queue_enter_live() before the allocation, and
release them all once the notifier is triggered.

Anyway this interface need to be well documented.

OK, I will change to 'wait', similar with 'dispatch_wait'.
