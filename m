Hi Jens,

Could you please take a look on this patch? It will be helpful if we can
have it in 4.14, then we can fix a bug introduced in 4.14-rc1.

This patch is reported by Michael Lyle, reviewed by Byungchul Park, and
finally verified by Michael Lyle after I posted the patch.

Many thanks in advance.
