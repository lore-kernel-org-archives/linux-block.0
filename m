Because no in-kernel users should be mucking with the IO scheduler. Adding
this back is just an excuse for drivers to start doing it again, which
generally happens because whatever vendors driver team tests some synthetic
benchmark and decide that X is better than the default of Y. So we're not
going back to that.

I'm trying, I made suggestions on how we can proceed - we can have a way
to insert to hctx->dispatch without bothering the IO scheduler. I'm
open to other suggestions as well, just not open to exporting an
interface to change IO schedulers from inside the kernel.
