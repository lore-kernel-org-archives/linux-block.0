The only purpose of rcu_read_lock() would be to ensure the object
isn't freed out from under you. That's not an issue here.

Racing with other writers isn't a correctness issue here, and if it
was - just throwing write_lock around where you have it wouldn't be
sufficient, you'd need something much more complicated.
