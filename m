Yeah, the original code was careful about only adding the verification
hook to the top bio.

A bio flag is probably the path of least resistance. It already exists,
actually: BIP_BLOCK_INTEGRITY. But we'll need to make sure it gets
masked out when a bio is cloned. And then we can key off of that and
REQ_OP_READ in the endio function.

I prefer that approach to reverting Christoph's commit.
