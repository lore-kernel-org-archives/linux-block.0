Jens, and everyone:

Here is the current series of work for inclusion in next and for 4.15's
merge window.  We may get some additional fixes, but this is most of the
work we expect.  All have been previously sent to these lists except the
very last one.

There's a lot of small cleanup patches and fixes for race conditions.

Also included is my new rate controller which we've been measuring for
some time, and other related changes to writeback rate management.

Thanks,

Mike
