And on it's own that isn't an argument if your usage is indeed wrong,
and that's why we are having this discussion.

We can simply add another bio flag to get back to the previous
behavior.  That being said thing to do in the end is to verify it
at the top of the stack, and not the bottom eventuall.  I can cook
up a patch for that.

And with this you will just reintroduce the memory leak for
on-stack bios we've fixed.

I'll take a look at not calling the verify function for every level,
which is wrong, and in the meantime we can discuss the uses and abuses
of the bio integrity code by dm in the separate subthread.
