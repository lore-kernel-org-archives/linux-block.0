That would create one more process per dm device.

There is no need to create another process if the bio can be split in the 
device mapper.

It would be possible to split bios on BIO_MAX_PAGES boundary in the dm 
core. But I checked all the dm targets and I found problem only in 
dm-crypt and dm-log-writes. So there is no need to split bio bios for the 
other targets.
