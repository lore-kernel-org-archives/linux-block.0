It'll fix the forever stall, but it won't really fix it, as we'll slow
down the dm device by some random amount.

A simple test case would be to have a null_blk device with a queue depth
of one, and dm on top of that. Start a fio job that runs two jobs: one
that does IO to the underlying device, and one that does IO to the dm
device. If the job on the dm device runs substantially slower than the
one to the underlying device, then the problem isn't really fixed.

That said, I'm fine with ensuring that we make forward progress always
first, and then we can come up with a proper solution to the issue. The
forward progress guarantee will be needed for the more rare failure
cases, like allocation failures. nvme needs that too, for instance, for
the discard range struct allocation.
