Tejun replied earlier with an indepth answer. Thanks Tejun! I'll make
sure to add a comment detailing what's going on.

Initially I thought the BFQ and CFQ stuff only interacted with bios
which should already be associated. Turns out during init, they rely on
that bio_blkcg to read from current and then do the wrong thing of hard
associating with it (_get vs _tryget).

I've created a __bio_blkcg which is identical to the old function with
notes to not use it. Making changes to BFQ and CFQ would take a good bit
more work to make sure I'm not breaking what they're expecting to do, so
I leave that to future work.

Done.

Thanks,
