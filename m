I don't think it's plausible that this new patch was actually tested.
The version I sent in 2024 was tested at the time
(https://lore.kernel.org/r/20241016232748.134211-3-ebiggers@kernel.org/),
but I see at least two things that would make this new patch not work.

First, the call to blk_crypto_init_key() will always fail, since it's
being passed BLK_CRYPTO_KEY_TYPE_HW_WRAPPED but using a 64-byte raw key.

It needs to be BLK_CRYPTO_KEY_TYPE_RAW.  (BLK_CRYPTO_KEY_TYPE_HW_WRAPPED
support would make sense to add as an extra feature, once the basic raw
key support is working.  Note that when I sent the first version of this
patch, support for wrapped keys was not yet upstream at all.)

Second, since v7.0-rc1, submitters of bios don't automatically get
blk-crypto-fallback support; they need to request it explicitly.  So,
this patch will not work with blk-crypto-fallback anymore.

If you'd like to continue work on this patch, it might be helpful to
check the latest version of dm-default-key.c in "android-mainline"
(https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/common/+/android-mainline/drivers/md/dm-default-key.c)
and resynchronize this patch with it.  It already has the code to
correctly support both key types and blk-crypto-fallback, for example.

Either way, this patch also needs to be re-tested with the latest
upstream kernel, which doesn't seem to have happened unfortunately.
