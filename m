The return value from .queue_rq() is handled by blk-mq, why do you think
it can be ignored? Please see blk_mq_dispatch_rq_list().

This only happens iff queue is stopped or quiesced, then we return
BLK_STS_OK to blk-mq via .queue_rq(), please see __blk_mq_try_issue_directly(),
how does this cause IO hang?

No, this case won't return BLK_STS_RESOURCE.
