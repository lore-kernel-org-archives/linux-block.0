It's one of those choices: "if something can't work as intended, should it be
allowed to work at all?" I believe different use cases will have different
answers to this question. So ideally this should be configurable by some kind
of option stored in superblock, much like the "Errors behavior" option of ext*
filesystems.

Of course, this only applies to "writethrough" and "writearound" modes with
zero dirty data; "writeback" bcache devices (or devices switched from
writeback and still having some dirty data) should probably be disabled if the
cache device fails.
