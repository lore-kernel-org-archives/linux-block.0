If you're hitting blk_mq_sched_insert_request() then you most certainly
are hitting that code path.

If you aren't then what was your earlier email going on about?
https://www.redhat.com/archives/dm-devel/2018-January/msg00372.html

If you were just focusing on that as one possible reason, that isn't
very helpful.  By this point you really should _know_ what is triggering
the stall based on the code paths taken.  Please use ftrace's
function_graph tracer if need be.

Please be precise, dm_mq_queue_rq()'s return of BLK_STS_RESOURCE?
"Incorrect" because it no longer runs blk_mq_delay_run_hw_queue()?

Please try to do more work analyzing the test case that only you can
easily run (due to srp_test being a PITA).  And less time lobbying for
a change that you don't understand to _really_ be correct.

We have time to get this right, please stop hyperventilating about
"regressions".

Thanks,
Mike
