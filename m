That will break SG_IO, firmware upgrades, etc. (things you probably
shouldn't do on the MP device in the first place but which users often
do).

However, doesn't it make more sense to tweak limits on DM device instead
of the underlying ones? It seems a bit counter-intuitive to me to change
max_sectors_kb on a different device than the one where the filesystem
whose max I/O size you want to change is located.

I guess this brings us back to the desire to be able to restack the
limits at will when something changes somewhere...
