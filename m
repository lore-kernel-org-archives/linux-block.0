I have enabled multi-page bvec for passthrough IO in the following:

https://github.com/ming1/linux/commits/v5.0-blk-for-blk_post_mp

in which .bi_phys_segments becomes same with .bi_vcnt for passthrough bio.

Also intra-bvec merging in one bio has been killed, then only the merge
between bios is required, and seems we still need front/back segment size,
especially some use cases(such as mkfs) may make lots of small mergeable bios.

It should be easy to observe that .bv_len is bigger than max segment
size.

Ming
