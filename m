That way is still buggy as I explained, since rerun queue before adding
request to hctx->dispatch_list isn't correct. Who can make sure the request
is visible when __blk_mq_run_hw_queue() is called?

Not mention this way will cause performance regression again.

Right, it is a generic issue, not DM-specific one, almost all drivers
call kmalloc(GFP_ATOMIC) in IO path.

IMO, there is enough time for figuring out a generic solution before
4.16 release.

Now most of times both NVMe and SCSI won't return BLK_STS_RESOURCE, and
it should be DM-only which returns STS_RESOURCE so often.

Yeah, it is right.
