Hello Kent

I do not think so. In for_each_cached_btree(), we traverse all
btrees by hlist_for_each_entry_rcu(), and the hlist_for_each_entry_rcu()
should be protect by rcu lock, as the API describle bellow:
 * This list-traversal primitive may safely run concurrently with
 * the _rcu list-mutation primitives such as hlist_add_head_rcu()
 * as long as the traversal is guarded by rcu_read_lock().
 */
#define hlist_for_each_entry_rcu(pos, head, member)			\
	for (pos = hlist_entry_safe (rcu_dereference_raw(hlist_first_rcu(head)),\

since we only read by hlist_for_each_entry_rcu(), so I think we does not 
need any more write locker.
