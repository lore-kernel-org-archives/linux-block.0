No, it is not.

This DM_MAPIO_REQUEUE will be converted to BLK_STS_RESOURCE in dm-rq, then
it is returned to blk-mq. That means when running out of resource for
dispatching the underlying request, we tell blk-mq the truth. This
way has been used for other blk-mq drivers, such NVMe,..., more
importantly we have to provide this real feedback to blk-mq for fixing
the performance issue.

The blk_get_request(GFP_ATOMIC) is just like a kmalloc(ATOMIC),
and memory is shared system-wide too. You can see there are lots kmalloc(ATOMIC)
in NVMe IO path, when it fails, BLK_STS_RESOURCE is returned to blk-mq.

blk-mq has built-in SCHED_RESTART mechanism to handle out of RESOURCE
when BLK_STS_RESOURCE is observed.

We only implements .get_bugdet() in SCSI only, and other blk-mq drivers: NVMe,
..., often returns BLK_STS_RESOURCE to blk-mq too, so wrt. this usage there
isn't any difference between dm-mpath and other cases, right?


Thanks,
