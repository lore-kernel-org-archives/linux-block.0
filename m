Agreed that this should not be an optional feature.

One thing which always bothers me is that often we have dependencies
on finishing of these bios. So if we assign bios to their original
cgroups and if we create a cgroup with very low limit, then its
possible that everything slows down.

I guess answer to that is its a configuration issue and don't
create groups with too small a limits. And don't allow unprivileged
users to specify group limits.
