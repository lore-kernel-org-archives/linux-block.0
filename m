I haven't lowered my standards. I thought this posting was pretty clear
- it's an experiment in what supporting legacy schedulers would look
like. As you quote me above, this is NOT proposed for merging, nor do I
consider it anywhere near clean.

You missed it, it's in blk_mq_sched_init(), called from
elv_iosched_store() when trying to switch (or setup a new) schedulers.

See BLK_MQ_F_NO_SCHED.

See above, it's just an experiment in seeing what this would look like,
how transparent (or not) we could make that.

Don't overthink any of this, and don't start making plans or coming up
with problems on why X or Y would not work with whatever interface
variant of dm. That's jumping the gun.
