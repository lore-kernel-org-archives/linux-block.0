Functionality shouldn't be any different than the variant (Ming's v4)
that Laurence tested on Sunday/Monday (once we got past the genirq issue
on HPSA).

But sure, I suppose there is something I missed when refactoring Ming's
change to get it acceptable for upstream.  I went over the mechanical
nature of what I did many times (comaping Ming's v4 to my v5).

Anyway, we'll see how Laurence fairs with this tree (but with the revert
of 84676c1 added, so his HPSA server will boot):
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/snitzer/linux.git/log/?h=block-4.16_dm-4.16
(which is the same as linux-dm.git's 'for-next' at the moment)

The call to blk_mq_request_bypass_insert will only occur via
__blk_mq_fallback_to_insert.  Which as the name implies this is not the
fast path.  This will occur if the underlying blk-mq device cannot get
resources it needs in order to issue the request.  Specifically: if/when
in __blk_mq_try_issue_directly() the hctx is stopped, or queue is
quiesced, or it cannot get the driver tag or dispatch_budget (in the
case of scsi-mq).

The same fallback, via call to blk_mq_request_bypass_insert, occured
with Ming's v4 though.

Anyway, we'll see what Laurence finds when testing my above kernel.
