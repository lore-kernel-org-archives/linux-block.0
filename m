Another problem is this:

struct bio *b = bio_clone_bioset(bio, GFP_NOIO, md->queue->bio_split);
bio_advance(b, (bio_sectors(b) - ci.sector_count) << 9);
bio_chain(b, bio);

What if it blocks because the bioset is exhausted?

The code basically builds a chain of bios of unlimited length (suppose for 
example a case when we are splitting on every sector boundary, so there 
will be one bio for every sector in the original bio), it could exhaust 
the bioset easily.

It would be better to use mechanism from md-raid that chains all the 
sub-bios to the same master bio and doesn't create long chains of bios:

        if (max_sectors < bio_sectors(bio)) {
                struct bio *split = bio_split(bio, max_sectors,
                                              gfp, conf->bio_split);
                bio_chain(split, bio);
                generic_make_request(bio);
                bio = split;
                r1_bio->master_bio = bio;
                r1_bio->sectors = max_sectors;
        }
