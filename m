I don't like the idea of complicating the code by turning discards into 
writes. You can just turn off the flag "discard_zeroes_data" and drop all 
the splitting code.

The flag "discard_zeroes_data" is actually misdesigned, because the 
storage stack can change dynamically while bios are in progress. You can 
send a discard bio to a device mapper device that has 
"discard_zeroes_data" - and while the bio is in progress, the device 
mapper stack can be reconfigured to redirect the bio to another device 
that doesn't have "discard_zeroes_data" - and the bio won't zero data and 
the caller that issued it has no way to find it out.

I think the proper thing would be to move "discard_zeroes_data" flag into 
the bio itself - there would be REQ_OP_DISCARD and REQ_OP_DISCARD_ZERO - 
and if the device doesn't support REQ_OP_DISCARD_ZERO, it rejects the bio 
and the caller is supposed to do zeroing manually.
