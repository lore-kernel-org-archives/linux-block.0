Hi Mike and Junhui,

Aha! mutex bucket_lock is held in bch_bucket_alloc_set(), which is 2
layers up in the caller :-) In sequence, __bch_bucket_free() has
bucket_lock held too. They are safe.

Since there is mutex protected avai_nbuckets, this patch is good to me.
Nothing needs to be changed. Thanks for Mike's double check.
