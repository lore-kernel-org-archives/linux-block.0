Hi Pavel and Nix,

These days I am working on back porting and response emails a little bit
slowly.

Most of the intention is from our customers, and partners from data
base, cloud service, Ceph storage and so on. So yes, it is mostly
enterprise use cases focused.

I take Nix's suggestion in serious, and I will try to see whether it is
possible to add a default-disabled option. When it is enabled, cache set
retiring won't stop bcache devices if cache set is clean.

In order to make the failure handling simple and fast, I will not
distinct each bcache device whether it has dirty data on cache set. Once
the cache set is dirty, all attached bcache devices will be stopped.

It seems when this option is enabled by users, it should work for
writeback and writethrough, and no side effect to writearound and non.

Nix, how do you think of the above idea ?

Thanks for all your constructive discussion :-)
