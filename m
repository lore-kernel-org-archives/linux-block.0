That patch isn't going to be of much help. It might prevent you from
completely stalling, but it might take you tens of seconds to get there.

On top of that, it's a rolling timer that gets added when IO is queued,
and re-added if IO is pending when it fires. If the latter case is not
true, then it won't get armed again. So if IO fails to queue without
any other IO pending, you're pretty much in the same situation as if
you marked the queue as restart. Nobody is going to be noticing
either of those conditions.
