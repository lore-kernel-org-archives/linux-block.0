Tang--

This is a first step towards further stuff I want to do--

1. I want to allow blk_plug-- but to do that, a request needs to know
there are subsequent contiguous requests after it when issuing the
write.  The new structure allows that.
2. I want to allow tuning to issue multiple requests and control IO
priorities for them, so that we can make use of queue depth on backing
devices.  The new code structure allows for inserting heuristics to do
that very easily.  When 4 operations are issued at a time, latency
doesn't suffer very much and throughput can be 30-40% higher.
3. There's a small change to the delay calculation that will allow the
actual inner delay controller to be improved to do lower rates for
laptops and allow backing disk spindown.

But I need more testing and more time to complete those, and there's
already a benefit with the current structure.
