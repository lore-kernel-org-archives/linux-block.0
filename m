Yes, you are right something like that would be better.
Also send_changing_extent_only allocates bios in a loop which can cause
problems.
I think we need to get __split_and_process_non_flush(), in all its
branches, to check if len is too large for a single request, and if it
is, create a clone for the prefix, attached that to the ci and map it,
advance the original bio, and call generic_make_request on it.
That shouldn't be too hard, but it is a change that would touch a few
places.

I'll see if I can write something.

Thanks,
NeilBrown
