Well, there is the "Fail-Fast" principle [1] and all that. For a home user
(which is my case, for example), this approach doesn't make much sense.
However, large-scale users, like cloud providers, can have a different point
of view.

It's just a speculation on my part, but consider a bunch of bcache devices
that serve as parts of a RAID6 array. It may be desirable to deactivate the
bcache device that lost its caching capabilities, so that (1) the array would
not slow down, (2) the array would report its degraded state to
administrators.

Anyway, probably the author of this patch could explain it better. Maybe I
completely misunderstand the intention.
