md/raid0 remaps each bio and passes it directly down to one of several
devices.
I think your scheme would mean that it would need to clone each bio to
make sure it is from the correctly sized pool.

I suspect it could be made to work though.

1/ have a way for the driver receiving a bio to discover how much
   frontpad was allocated.
2/ require drivers to accept bios with any size of frontpad, but a
   fast-path is taken if it is already big enough.
3/ allow a block device to advertise it's preferred frontpad.
4/ make sure your config-change-notification mechanism can communicate
   changes to this number.
5/ gather statistics on what percentage of bios have a too-small
   frontpad.

Then start modifying places that allocate bios to use the hint,
and when benchmarks show the percentage is high - use it to encourage
other people to allocate better bios.
