Junhui,

That patch works well, but before I solve the latency of calculating
dirty stripe numbers, I won't push it upstream so far.

This patch does not conflict with my max-writeback-rate-when-idle, this
patch tries to fetch more dirty keys from cache device which are
continuous on cached device, and assume they can be continuously written
back to cached device.

For the above purpose, if writeback_rate is high, dc->last_read just
works well. But when dc->writeback_rate is low, e.g. 8, event
KEY_START(&w->key) == dc->last_read, the continuous key will only be
submit in next delay cycle. I feel Micheal wants to make larger
writeback I/O and delay more, then backing cached device may be woke up
less chance.

This policy only works better then current dc->last_read when
writeback_rate is low, that's say, when front write I/O is low or no
front write. I hesitate whether it is worthy to modify general writeback
logic for it.
