We could detect if the REQ_OP_WRITE_SAME command contains all zeroes and 
if it does, turn it into "Write Zeroes" or TRIM command (if the device 
guarantees zeroing on trim). If it doesn't contain all zeroes and the 
device doesn't support non-zero WRITE SAME, then reject it.

Or maybe we could add a new command REQ_OP_WRITE_ZEROES - I'm not sure 
which of these two possibilities is better.
