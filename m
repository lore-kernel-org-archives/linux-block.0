Hi Mike,

Recently we fixed one such issue in blk-mq (eb619fdb2d4cb8b3d34), and I
highly guess that may fix Bart's case.

Let's see this commit 6077c2d706 again, I don't know the idea behind the
fix, which just adds random of 100ms, and this delay degrades performance a
lot, since no hctx can be scheduled any more during the delay.

So again it is definitely a workaround, no any reasoning, no any theory, just
say it is a fix. Are there anyone who can explain the story?

IMO, the blk_get_request() in dm-mpath is just like a kmalloc(ATOMIC) which
is used in other blk-mq drivers' IO path too, so don't know why dm-mq is so
strange to require such ugly 100ms delay.

So I suggest to remove it, let's see if there are reports, and if there
are, I am quite confident we can root cause that and fix that.

I do test dm-mq over scsi-debug which is setup as two LUNs, and set
can_queue as 1, and this patchset just works well, not any IO hang.
And anyone can try and play with it.

Thanks,
Ming
