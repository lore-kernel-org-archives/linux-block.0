FYI, I've got a nice fast path for the driver side in nvme here, but
I'll need to do some more testing before submitting it:

http://git.infradead.org/users/hch/block.git/shortlog/refs/heads/nvme-optimize-single-segment-io

But in the block layer I think one major issue is all the phys_segments
crap.  What we really should do is to remove bi_phys_segments and all
the front/back segment crap and only do the calculation of the actual
per-bio segments once, just before adding the bio to the segment.

And don't bother with it at all unless the driver has weird segment
size or boundary limitations.
