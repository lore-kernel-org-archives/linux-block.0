Hi Kent,

OK, last time when I discuss with other bcache developers, people wanted
to keep this behavior, then I modify it as an option in this version
patch. I support fix it without an option, because there are too many
options already. Good to know you have similar decision :-)

I though of fixing here, the reason I gave up to modify here was,
cache_lookup_fn() is called for keys in leaf nodes (b->level == 0),
bch_btree_map_keys_recurse() needs to do I/O to fetch upper level nodes
before accessing leaf node. When a SSD failed bch_btree_node_get() will
fail before cache_lookup_fn() is executed. So the your patch, there is
no chance to set s->recoverable to false, recovery still happens.

If you don't like an option, the following modification should be much
simpler,

diff --git a/drivers/md/bcache/request.c b/drivers/md/bcache/request.c
index 681b4f12b05a..f397785d9c38 100644

+       struct cached_dev *dc = container_of(s->d, struct cached_dev, disk);

                trace_bcache_read_retry(s->orig_bio);

This might be the simplest way I know for now.

Thanks.
