Hi Bart
One thing to note.

I tested Mike's combined tree on the weekend fully dm4.16-block4.16 and
did not see this.
This was with Mike combined tree and SRPT running 4.13-rc2.

I also tested your tree Monday with the revert of the scatter/gather
patches with both SRP and SRPT running your tree and it was fine.

So its a combination of what you provided me before and that has been
added to your tree.

Mike combined tree seemed to be fine, I can revisit that if needed. I
still have that kernel in place.

I was not running latest SRPT when I tested Mike's tree


Regards
Laurence
