Hi Mike,

I agree with you. Yes, exactly it is. Performance optimization is always
perfectly for specific workload, it is almost no why to make everyone
happy. To me, most of time it is a trade off: if I want to have this, I
know there must be something I should pay or lose.

The decision is dependent on which kind of work load people cares about,
obviously we cannot get an agreement so far. For our discussion, it is
not just about correct or mistake, it is mainly about making choice.

I assume that if the bio reorder patches work better in above tests,
then maybe they will perform better with more complicated workloads as
well. This assumption might not be correct, but at least I can have
reproducible performance numbers to make decision.

This is not the first time I encounter such discussion like we have this
time. My rule is, let the data talk to each other.

You explain what your idea very well, it is clear to me. But if you
don't have reproducible performance data to support the idea, and tell
people the performance optimization result might be random, it will be
quite hard to help people to understand it and make decision for the
trade off.

Aha, I see why I felt so enjoyed when I read your patch (commit
9276717b9e29 ("bcache: fix bch_hprint crash and improve output")), you
are very experienced engineer. Your bio reorder patches work correctly
as you described, the problem is from me, I won't support this idea
because it may hurt performance of the workloads I care about.

It is rare to meet an experienced people like you, I do hope you may
stay here, continue to help us on patch review and code improvement.

Thanks.
