And yes there is one subtlety that I missed.

Turns out Ming's v4 doesn't fallback to insert for the "or it cannot get
the driver tag or dispatch_budget" case.

This patch should fix it (Laurence, please report back on if this fixes
your list_add corruption, pretty sure it will):

Subject: [PATCH] blk mq: don't blk_mq_request_bypass_insert _and_ return BLK_STS_RESOURCE

It isn't ever valid to call blk_mq_request_bypass_insert() and return
BLK_STS_RESOURCE.

Unfortunately after commit 396eaf21ee ("blk-mq: improve DM's blk-mq IO
merging via blk_insert_cloned_request feedback") we do just that if
blk_mq_request_direct_issue() cannot get the resources (driver_tag or
dispatch_budget) needed to directly issue a request.  This will lead to
"list_add corruption" because blk-mq submits the IO but then reports
that it didn't (BLK_STS_RESOURCE in this case).

Fix this by simply returning BLK_STS_RESOURCE for this case.

Fixes: 396eaf21ee ("blk-mq: improve DM's blk-mq IO merging via blk_insert_cloned_request feedback")
