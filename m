I like the change, hate the naming. I'd prefer one of two things:

- Add bio_endio_complete() instead. That name sucks too, the
  important part is flipping the __name() to have a trace
  version instead.

- Mark the bio as trace completed, and keep the naming. Since
  it's only off the completion path, that can be just marking
  the bi_flags non-atomically.

I probably prefer the latter.
